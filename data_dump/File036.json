Rent for the master would be $1300/month with a 1-year lease, starting on 8/1. We do have a cat, but he`s super friendly and floppy and enjoys playing fetch (we treat him like a dog.)\n What you`d get:\n Large unfurnished master bedroom on the main floor with walk-in closet. No en-suite bathroom, but the main floor`s bathroom is right next to the bedroom. The other two bedrooms are on the lower floor and share a bathroom, so the main floor`s would be mostly your`s except for when friends come over.\n Partially furnished common spaces - we`ve got a TV, a big couch, a small couch, foosball table, and a smattering of other random furniture collected over the past year. We`re still in the process of getting settled and plan on getting more furniture as we get adjusted to the house.\n Free street parking (you don`t even need a permit).\n Rent includes w/s/g.\n Details about the house, overall:\n Chef`s kitchen with stainless steel appliances, butcher block counter tops, tons of storage, and a great breakfast nook with plenty of light\n Huge living room, dining room, and yard. There`s a great view from the living room/front porch/yard of the city and Rainier on clear days.\n Convenient location close to 99 so there are a lot of bus stops within a few minutes of walking. Getting to Westlake Center takes about 15-20 minutes on the bus, depending on traffic. 5 is also easily accessible.\n The really good restaurants on 45th are a dangerously close five minute walk away. There`s also a nearby QFC.\n It`s a nice five mile loop if you run/bike from the house to all the way around Green Lake and back. Fremont and U-District are also within easy biking distance.\n Some info about us:\nWe`re two good friends who met in college and moved to Seattle last summer for work (tech start-up and consulting). We`re both girls, but we`ve lived with guys in the past and don`t mind doing so again. We enjoy spending time outside - hiking, ultimate frisbee, etc. - and love cooking and food. We go out most weekends, but also enjoy staying in and taking it easy to recharge. We are ideally looking for a roommate in their 20s that we can hang out with - the two of us have lived together in a house before that had a \"family\" vibe.\nIf you made it to the end of this post and are interested, shoot us an email with a short description about yourself and any questions you have!", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"source_account": "c6js8-4592564278@hous.craigslist.org", "source_neighborhood": "Wallingford", "w_d_in_unit": "YES", "original_posting_date": "1406616958", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+Whitman+Ave+N+at+N+%34%33rd+St+Seattle+WA+US", "dogs": "NO", "street_parking": "YES", "available": "aug 01", "source_subloc": "see", "no_smoking": "YES", "private_room": "YES", "source_loc": "seattle", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_continent": "USA", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=Whitman+Ave+N+at+N+%34%33rd+St&amp;csz=Seattle+WA&amp;country=US", "no_private_bath": "YES", "sqft": "3280", "source_state": "Washington", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Master bedroom in 3 bedroom house - 8/1 move-in", "cats": "YES"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406617015, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410505015, "id": 1248756169, "price": 1300.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SEA-SET", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-SEA", "locality": "USA-SEA-FRM", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SEA-SEA", "zipcode": "USA-98103", "long": "-122.345538", "county": "USA-WA-KIN", "state": "USA-WA", "lat": "47.65962", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00202_cHZXpVH8unW_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01414_gUh23aCEDDq_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_k57wuXea35i_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_bOuxriqtVGQ_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_24X9TXVtwMz_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_dkOw9yunA3q_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_lNy9dS3y3V7_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592564278", "heading": "Master bedroom in 3 bedroom house - 8/1 move-in", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://seattle.craigslist.org/see/roo/4592564278.html"}, {"body": "VERY NICE APARTMENT CLOSE TO BLUE LINE AND GREEN LINE CLOSE TO THE CITY 25 MINUTES TRAIN RIDE NOT BILLS TO PAID INCLUDES INTERNET AND CABLE PARKING SPACE AVAILABLE GREAT LOCATION CLOSE TO MALL AND SHOPS MORE INFOR EMAIL ME\n show contact info\n temporary lease month by month", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406232694", "dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "wcl", "source_account": "anao_anaoli@yahoo.com", "source_continent": "USA", "sqft": "638", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "OAK PARK", "source_state": "Illinois", "source_loc": "chicago", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "hsw|sbw", "source_heading": "FURNISH APARTMENT NOT BILLS TO PAID CLOSE TO BLUE AND GREEN LINE "}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406617023, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410505023, "id": 1249448420, "price": 1350.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-CHI-CHI", "geolocation_status": 5, "metro": "USA-CHI", "locality": "USA-CHI-LOO", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-CHI-CIT", "zipcode": "USA-60604", "long": "-87.6298", "county": "USA-IL-COO", "state": "USA-IL", "lat": "41.87811", "formatted_address": "Chicago, IL, USA", "accuracy": 7}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_iSLzwhYfIy7_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_goqpZOODF_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00808_2wT1P4R9D2H_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_iLyBqalzPpA_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4585599478", "heading": "FURNISH APARTMENT NOT BILLS TO PAID CLOSE TO BLUE AND GREEN LINE", "category": "RSUB", "external_url": "http://chicago.craigslist.org/wcl/sbw/4585599478.html"}, {"body": "This tastefully decorated third floor apartment is large enough to sleep 4+4 guests, making it suitable for multiple couples or a family traveling together.

The Pearl features 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in approximately 1,100 square feet and can accommodate up to 8 guests. The master bedroom features a brand-new Queen sized bed complete with luxury linens. A set of twin beds can be found in the guest room, while the living room also includes a pull-out sleeper sofa.

(If you need more space, storage or anything we can make that happen)\n WHAT IT COSTS - You`re share will be $650 TOTAL, That will cover ALL monthly charges plus $650 Safety Deposit.\n TESTIMONIAL - This really is a great place to live. I have been here for 10 years now. My last roommates will vouch for me and what an awesome place this is. All the neighbors are friendly and courteous.\n You really can`t find a much nicer place to call home.\n ME - Joe - 49 yr old male, NON-SMOKER, trustworthy, quiet, like to cook, pretty clean, courteous, very friendly and out going, college educated, slightly anal about a clean kitchen but other than that VERY easy to get along with. Big on morals and ethics. (you need to be Big On Morals and Ethics AS WELL!!!)\n The Other Housemate - Brandon - 45 yr old male (smoker) Quiet, clean, courteous, keeps to himself, very clean and is hardly ever home.\n YOU - Nonsmoker preferred, courteous, friendly, clean, trustworthy, easy to get along with. Male or Female OK\nI absolutely do not discriminate against race, color, ethnicity, gender, Yata Yata and we DON`T need to be best friends but we will need to get along. Life is too short to live with someone you don`t get along with so I reserve the right to choose the applicant that I feel will be the best fit. Oh, and you should feel the same about me.\n MOVE IN TIME -- August 1, 2014\nShoot me an email and we can talk and you can have a look around.\n PS. I have a dog. He weighs 19 pounds and is extremely lovable, VERY friendly and VERY well trained. You will not have to interact with him if you don`t want to (wow!! pretty hard not to though) but if you do, he`ll be be your best friend. Oh, and he doesn`t hardly shed at all :-) and NEVER EVER goes in the house. Again, house is pretty spotless. I also have friends that come over w/ very well behaved dogs from time to time so you should at least like dogs, ...I`m guessing.\nHousemate house mate roommate room house apartment, townhouse, town house", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1405558290", "available": "aug 01", "dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "eby", "source_account": "5snqd-4572791352@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "private_room": "YES", "no_private_bath": "YES", "sqft": "100", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "lafayette / orinda / moraga", "source_state": "California", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=West+Creek+Court+at+West+Rd%2E&amp;csz=Lafayette+CA&amp;country=US", "source_loc": "sfbay", "cats": "NO", "year": "2014", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+West+Creek+Court+at+West+Rd%2E+Lafayette+CA+US", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "1 More Housemate Wanted To Share a Big Town House"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406617122, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410505122, "id": 1248759734, "price": 650.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SFO-LAF", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-SFO", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SFO-EAS", "zipcode": "USA-94549", "long": "-122.128374", "county": "USA-CA-CON", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "37.888974", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_gnaeFY5oSgc_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00101_qbPM4rFlEs_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_iT2hV96zSSS_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_d0dp9oKOayQ_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_2PewFb7ob30_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_cBhAi7VmbNW_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_dXWFGX2E3wR_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_8uexrBfFYhF_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00303_jt1CnqQrctF_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_jmP2G3I0oQQ_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_6eNQQzV5ULa_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_842ZAJ4DzlL_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_2MWadixsgIl_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4572791352", "heading": "1 More Housemate Wanted To Share a Big Town House", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/4572791352.html"}, {"body": "Vacation Hotel Rentals In Las Vegas\nSpecial pricing at: PRVegas.com Click The \"Hotels\" Tab\n2 Free Buffets per Stay, ARIA Resort & Casino at CityCenter, Las Vegas\nSpecial deal: save 25%, Caesars Palace, Las Vegas\nLimited time offer: save 35%, Excalibur Hotel Casino, Las Vegas\n$20 Food and Beverage Credit, Flamingo Las Vegas, Las Vegas\n$20 Food and Beverage Credit, Harrah`s Hotel and Casino Las Vegas, Las Vegas\nFlash sale: save 50%, LVH -- Las Vegas Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas\nLimited time offer: save 35%, Luxor Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas\n2 Free Buffets per Stay, Mandalay Bay Resort And Casino, Las Vegas\nalso:\nLas Vegas Strip Hotel Airport Transfers\nLas Vegas Downtown Hotel Airport Transfers", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"available": "jun 30", "original_posting_date": "1404160676", "apartment": "YES", "dogs": "NO", "source_continent": "USA", "bedrooms": "0br", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Las Vegas, NV.", "source_state": "Nevada", "source_loc": "lasvegas", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "vac", "source_heading": "Vacation Hotel Rentals In Las Vegas"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406617128, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410505128, "id": 1248778865, "price": 20.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-LAS-LAS", "geolocation_status": 5, "metro": "USA-LAS", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-89109", "long": "-115.17282", "county": "USA-NV-CLA", "state": "USA-NV", "lat": "36.11465", "formatted_address": "Las Vegas, NV, USA", "accuracy": 7}, "images": [], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4546785612", "heading": "Vacation Hotel Rentals In Las Vegas", "category": "RVAC", "external_url": "http://lasvegas.craigslist.org/vac/4546785612.html"}, {"body": "NARRAGANSETT -

I had to refine my search. I`m looking for someone who actually has their sh*t together.\n***Those with no credit history (650 or less score), job history, or references need not apply.***\n***Price range 1250-1500 PER PERSON***\n***No Pets***\nIf I haven`t gotten back to your e-mails yet I`m sorry for not responding I`ve been short on time and trying to keep up with everyone`s budgets/situations in a log to help make a decision.\nWhat I`m seeking:\nI`m a 25 y/o male professional, graduated from a university in 2010 and recently moved to SB for a new job. I`m seeking someone who`s in a similar situation and wanting to have their own space at a fraction of the cost of a 1BR on their own.\nLifestyle:\nI`d describe myself as a social athletic nerd. I like laughing and making others laugh. I am a kind and generous person who has a great family. Want to ride bikes/go running/go paddleboarding? I`m in. Want to play soccer/kickball/tennis/surf/snowboard/wakeboard? I`m in. But also: want to play FIFA? COD? NBA 2k? I`m in, and I`ll beat you. Can`t figure out why you WiFi/computer/game console/tv/electronic device isn`t working properly? I can probably fix it. Want to buy something for a good deal? I can find it for you. I recently became addicted to finding deals on literally everything I purchase, and I would happily take on purchasing shared household goods which will save us both money. Imagine never running out of TP or paper towels, pretty sweet right?\nPartying:\nEveryone posting on craigslist is so uptight! I like being social, but I also like the sound of silence too. I was in a frat in college and have been to more than a few parties, but now that I work full time and have bills to pay I really only go out drinking once or twice a week. I am really not interested in throwing parties at the apartment, but I don`t want either of us restricted from having guests over. I also like BBQing so possible get-togethers during the day may be in order. Lastly, I do have friends that want to come visit from out of town sometimes, so you should be OK with that. In a nutshell, as long as we discuss with each other our plans I`m sure we can work it out.\nCleanliness:\nWith most postings, it looks like OCD cleanliness is required, but let`s get real. Common places take priority and will need to be kept presentable and clean. If I have a busy week my room might get cluttered, but I won`t let that spread to common areas. Take responsibility for your own messes, but if the place needs a quick clean in general, I have no problem with the both of us pitching in to clean up, nor am I opposed to splitting the cost of regular cleaning service.\nWhen:\nAug 1st/Sept 1st Hopefully Aug 1 or early August but I think extending my search for a month might work best as far as finding something I`m happy to sign a lease on.\nLocation:\nDowntown, Mesa, Upper State Area, or would consider Riviera\nSize:\n2BR2BR\n********Edited*********\nPRICE:\nLet`s just narrow this down a bit...\n$1250-1500 each person\nThere are some AWWEEESOOOOMEEE places in this price range. If we find cheaper great, but I`d rather show you what I mean with examples and you won`t want to settle. I have a few listings in this range I`ve spotted online if you`re interested e-mail a response and I`ll share them if you want to apply quickly.\n**********[edited]**********\nPet Friendly:\nI am an animal lover, but it may be easier to find a place without your dog. Sorry.\nWhat I`m looking for in you:\nYou are:\n-Respectful of my space and things. Taking my food/drink/whatever without asking is a pet peeve. I also don`t want you going into my room uninvited/unannounced/while I`m not home.\n-Able to communicate-if you have an issue let`s lay it out on the table, let`s not be passive aggressive and hold onto stuff forever\n-Clean-you can keep common areas clean and generally stay tidy. We`re not in college anymore, let`s be ready for guests at any time.\n-Fiscally responsible, with acceptable credit and references.\n-A professional-or not undergrad\nIf you`re interested, respond to the e-mail ASAP with a bit about yourself and I will give you a call or respond if there`s potential. If you have a Facebook or Instagram please share and I`ll do the same.\nThanks", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406617038", "source_account": "2bc4j-4592564722@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "cats": "NO", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Santa Barbara", "source_state": "California", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=34.423620&amp;lon=-119.711494&zoom=16", "source_loc": "santabarbara", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@34.423620,-119.711494,16z", "source_subcat": "roo", "year": "2010", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "dogs": "NO", "source_heading": "[updated] Seeking 1 Roommate to Share 2BR $2500-3000 Total"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406617161, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410505161, "id": 1248758093, "price": 1250.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SAB-SAB", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-SAB", "locality": "USA-SAB-DOW", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-93101", "long": "-119.711494", "county": "USA-CA-SAB", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "34.42362", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_2eOntdiKZOd_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592564722", "heading": "updated Seeking 1 Roommate to Share 2BR $2500-3000 Total", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://santabarbara.craigslist.org/roo/4592564722.html"}], "time_taken": 2751.317024230957, "new_postings": 2446342, "time_fetch": 2519.2010402679443, "num_matches": 270074, "anchor": 1258324525, "next_tier": 0}
