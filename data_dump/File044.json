I am moving out of my current sublet August 8th and need someone to fill my room until Sept 1st. At that point the lease will become month to month and you`ll have the option to continue renting until at least the end of Dec.\nRent is $1305/month plus ~$80 for utilities.\nThe room is big, gets great natural light, and there are 2 bathrooms so you only share a bathroom with one other person. You would have 3 other roommates (all awesome girls in their mid-twenties), washer/dryer, backyard, garage for storage, and an incredible view of the Golden Gate Bridge from the kitchen window! You are 3 blocks away from Fisherman`s Wharf and Fort Mason and super close to all of the great bars/restaurants on Polk St. If you have a car there is plenty of street parking. I also currently have one of the parking spots in the garage which is available for an additional $150/month.\nThe small caveat is that my room is a converted living room with sliding doors that lead into the master so one roommate and her (adorable/quiet/hypoallergenic) dog will walk through occasionally. It has not been a privacy issue at all this year and definitely won`t be for such a small amount of time! As you can see in the pictures, the kitchen is big enough to fit two couches and serves as great communal space.\nPlease reply if you are interested and include a little bit about yourself. A link to your Facebook profile would be helpful and will speed up the process. I will get back to you as soon as possible and we can hopefully set up a time this week for you to view the room!", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406620751", "source_subloc": "sfc", "source_account": "vn59v-4592582274@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "cats": "NO", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "russian hill", "source_state": "California", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=37.802490&amp;lon=-122.423088&zoom=16", "source_loc": "sfbay", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@37.802490,-122.423088,16z", "source_subcat": "roo", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "dogs": "NO", "source_heading": "Room in Russian Hill available 8/8"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406621574, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410509574, "id": 1249270013, "price": 1305.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SFO-SNF", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-SFO", "locality": "USA-SFO-RUS", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SFO-SAF", "zipcode": "USA-94109", "long": "-122.423088", "county": "USA-CA-SAF", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "37.80249", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01111_kGx5VKe1Zeg_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_8QhgQ7x8uFh_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_ia0UshbItmr_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_kqhxQK00Wx5_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592582274", "heading": "Room in Russian Hill available 8/8", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/roo/4592582274.html"}, {"body": "This one-of-a-kind rental is right in the heart of the nation`s oldest city.\nSt. Augustine`s rich history is all within walking distance.

The listing photos were exactly as it looked when we arrived , the location was perfect , and the property was immaculate ! We had our 2 furry babies with us and it was perfect for them because the courtyard was completely enclosed . We were so close to town that we could walk , or ride the bikes that are provided for you including lock and helmets . The grounds across the street were perfect for walking the dogs .The area was completley safe to walk in during the evenings and the kayaks were great ( they also had life vests with them ) . The bed and pillows were comfy and the house was well equipped , including a gas grill. I give this property a 5 out of 5 . It was wonderful and we will most definently stay here again !!!\"", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"bathrooms": "1ba", "furnished": "YES", "source_neighborhood": "St. Augustine", "off_street_parking": "YES", "year": "2014", "original_posting_date": "1406621330", "apartment": "YES", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+Pine+Street+at+Water+Street+Saint+Augustine+FL+US", "source_subcat": "vac", "source_heading": "Steps from St. Augustine`s historic downtown", "available": "jul 29", "no_smoking": "YES", "bedrooms": "1br", "phone": "3524252872", "source_loc": "staugustine", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_continent": "USA", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=Pine+Street+at+Water+Street&amp;csz=Saint+Augustine+FL&amp;country=US", "sqft": "700", "source_state": "Florida", "dogs": "YES", "cats": "YES"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406621596, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410509596, "id": 1249286305, "price": 150.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-JAF-SAA", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-JAF", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-32084", "long": "-81.313258", "county": "USA-FL-SAJ", "state": "USA-FL", "lat": "29.902819", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_4Cx0OBZ7nxR_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_626lW8Qd07d_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_9avjxXe2CeO_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_hFNNzppBt5Q_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01717_eOVFupP4hkI_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_a8o6cjyV89f_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01616_l7NcVRdXEAx_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_lwtTo0J3vRr_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01414_iE4gaDFz0wu_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_fHj7feeNaAg_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_lmQckXMgeqK_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00808_dpXM2FgRuPx_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01010_9UmYPSQaoib_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_4NTBlNGGUqo_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_6uJzF9b0tQb_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_2sH0lLYu9zP_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_jAfKaXl5FNT_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_aZ0YisPSrNo_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592584603", "heading": "Steps from St. Augustines historic downtown", "category": "RVAC", "external_url": "http://staugustine.craigslist.org/vac/4592584603.html"}, {"body": "I`m a licensed professional business lady, mid-age.

Almost everything in the house is new including the appliances and the heating system. No washer and drier in the house. We use two laundromats nearby.\nWE ARE\ntwo females (in our 20s) and a male (middle-aged) roommates. Friendly and considerate, highly professional in our respective fields: a graduate student, an editorial assistant and a professional writer who travels often. We are all new to this area and have different hours and schedules, doing our own things. Each and every one of us is very invested in our academic pursuits and we try to keep the atmosphere conducive to studying and resting. A couple of house-rules are in place : No loud music or TV in the apartment and we rarely have visitors, let alone overnight guests. We know these rules will be a major turn-off to many people, but we believe we can find a like-minded roommate who can have fun outside the house. Folks upstairs are affiliates at Harvard, BU, Northeastern and Boston Medical Center etc.\nSEEKING\nA roommate who is clean and quiet, non-smoking and without pets or overnight guest.

Ping me if interested,\nAmanda", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"carport": "YES", "source_account": "pks6r-4592586907@hous.craigslist.org", "source_neighborhood": "Bellevue", "w_d_in_unit": "YES", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+%31%32%36%33%31+NE+%39th+PL+at+%31%32%34th+NE+bellevue++WA+US", "dogs": "NO", "source_heading": "Homeshare with professional female; all emenities provided ", "available": "sep 01", "source_subloc": "est", "no_smoking": "YES", "private_room": "YES", "source_loc": "seattle", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_continent": "USA", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=%31%32%36%33%31+NE+%39th+PL+at+%31%32%34th+NE&amp;csz=bellevue++WA&amp;country=US", "wheelchair_accessible": "YES", "sqft": "500", "source_state": "Washington", "source_subcat": "roo", "no_private_bath": "YES", "cats": "NO"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406621931, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410509931, "id": 1249310544, "price": 700.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SEA-BEL", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-SEA", "locality": "USA-SEA-OVE", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SEA-EAS", "zipcode": "USA-98005", "long": "-122.170914", "county": "USA-WA-KIN", "state": "USA-WA", "lat": "47.618415", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_dVteC4cWIbe_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_i1GHPTJGA3E_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_5llFP1dsAAb_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01111_6FoPrxQZD5i_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_hdrP6ydG8OS_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_cUZk3WEHsu4_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_cSo0j65UyNw_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592586907", "heading": "Homeshare with professional female; all emenities provided", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://seattle.craigslist.org/est/roo/4592586907.html"}], "time_taken": 773.5941410064697, "new_postings": 2447729, "time_fetch": 595.6919193267822, "num_matches": 270074, "anchor": 1258324525, "next_tier": 0}
