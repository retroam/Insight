It has 2 large closets and windows that face south. Rent includes water, heat, and trash removal. There is one off-street parking space that we can fight over but there`s plenty of street parking. Electricity and WiFi will be split amongst the two of us. One month deposit required, one year agreement.\nShared space includes the kitchen, bathroom, dining room, living room, and attic storage.\nThere is a laundry room and storage room in the basement. It`s about a 10-15 minute walk to downtown Stamford restaurants, library, shops, and Mall. Only a 2 minute walk to Ridgeway Shopping Center.\nI am a young, female professional. I will not be home on most weekends so you`ll have the whole place to yourself. I cook occasionally and I bake more than occasionally. I work in Tarrytown M-F, 9-5. I like to keep things tidy. I have respect for the shared space. I will be moving in by August 8th.\nI`m looking for someone in similar standing, preferably a female professional. Someone who likes to keep tidy, especially in the shared space. You do not smoke, do not have pets (but are OK with cats), do not like crazy parties. You are low key, laid back, and a stickler for cleanliness. You will take the master bedroom for $1100/month, moving in between August 12 and August 15. If you are the ideal person, move-in can be postponed to September 1st.\nPlease email me if you`re interested. Be sure to include a short description of yourself.\nPictures here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7chjs90upwkcejd/AAAaxbAyF6lHHtbAk7Jo6Rofa", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"source_account": "p3p5p-4587905410@hous.craigslist.org", "source_neighborhood": "Stamford", "laundry_on_site": "YES", "off_street_parking": "YES", "original_posting_date": "1406354113", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+Summer+St+at+%34th+Street+Stamford+CT+US", "dogs": "NO", "source_heading": "Looking for Housemate in 2bd/1bth Townhouse - MOST UTILITIES INCL", "available": "aug 12", "source_subloc": "fct", "no_smoking": "YES", "private_room": "YES", "source_loc": "newyork", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_continent": "USA", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=Summer+St+at+%34th+Street&amp;csz=Stamford+CT&amp;country=US", "no_private_bath": "YES", "sqft": "1054", "source_state": "New York", "source_subcat": "roo", "cats": "NO"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406610748, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410498748, "id": 1248540418, "price": 1100.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-NYM-STM", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-NYM", "locality": "USA-NYM-DOS", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-06905", "long": "-73.544583", "county": "USA-CT-FAI", "state": "USA-CT", "lat": "41.065019", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_Gd09D02s0K_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00202_c0W9ZVGGbQk_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_jsaV1Q0xpNX_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_kMddhm4nKKA_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4587905410", "heading": "Looking for Housemate in 2bd/1bth Townhouse - MOST UTILITIES INCL", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/fct/roo/4587905410.html"}, {"body": "Who needs a nice place to live- the rent of 395.00 includes utilies & wifi, room is unfurnished, security deposit of 200.00 is required, can be month to month, 3 or 6 month lease, room is ready to move in.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1404704346", "dogs": "NO", "source_account": "br63v-4556173893@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_state": "Tennessee", "source_neighborhood": "48/13, Riverside drive", "source_loc": "clarksville", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "city / county living - utilies"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406610749, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410498749, "id": 1248489975, "price": 395.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-CAV-CLA", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-CAV", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-37040", "long": "-87.36358", "county": "USA-TN-MOT", "state": "USA-TN", "lat": "36.52651", "formatted_address": "13 South Riverside Drive, Clarksville, TN 37040, USA", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4556173893", "heading": "city / county living - utilies", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://clarksville.craigslist.org/roo/4556173893.html"}, {"body": "3 bdrm/3 bath furnished condo at Windy Shores II is avail. 8/16 to 23.

Type the name in on google to see the website.\nAs of 7/28/14, they do not currently have any rooms, however I will keep whoever texts or emails me about when an opening is in.\nA little about myself- I am currently working at the Hollywood Fred Meyer and will be attending PCC Cascade this fall to continue my education as I am aiming to become store director. I have an angel of a cat, her name is Lucy, (Friendly dogs are okay in the apartment along with other cats), however there is a deposit as you can read about on the website above. My cat is a black american shorthair and goes by Lucy, but when she is naughty, she is called \"Lucifer.\" (She also has 6 toes on each paw ;) I am Mormon (ironically trying to figure out my sexuality) and don`t drink or smoke and prefer the same for my room mate however casual drinking is okay but no parties with irresponsible and disrespectful people.\nWho I am looking for- I am looking for a mature female or male between the ages of 20-35 who is clean, quiet and courteous as I will be to them, (unless we decide to have a small get together ;) I would like my roommate to be employed and have a clean background. Smoking is okay but I prefer not. Social drinking as long as it`s not an issue. It is okay if you have a dog, who is okay with cats, or an additional cat. I would love for you to get to know me before we talk about living situations and all that.\nI have posted that the rent is $450, however that may go slightly up or down depending on utilities which I still have to find out.\nPlease feel free to text or email me at all hours of the day if you would be interested.\nI look forward to hearing from you,\n-Colter.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"available": "sep 01", "dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "mlt", "carport": "YES", "source_account": "cn5xt-4592516873@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "private_room": "YES", "no_private_bath": "YES", "sqft": "800", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "NE Portland", "w_d_in_unit": "YES", "source_state": "Oregon", "phone": "2086951215", "source_loc": "portland", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+%38%32%37+NE+%39%39th+Avenue%2C+Portland%2C+OR+%39%37%32%32%30+Map++Portland+OR+US", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=%38%32%37+NE+%39%39th+Avenue%2C+Portland%2C+OR+%39%37%32%32%30+Map+&amp;csz=Portland+OR&amp;country=US", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "cats": "YES", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Looking for roommate in future apartment"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406610787, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410498787, "id": 1248544408, "price": 450.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-POR-POR", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-POR", "locality": "USA-POR-HAZ", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-POR-MUL", "zipcode": "USA-97220", "long": "-122.561906", "county": "USA-OR-MUL", "state": "USA-OR", "lat": "45.529466", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592516873", "heading": "Looking for roommate in future apartment", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/roo/4592516873.html"}, {"body": "This may be the most perfect Student/Intern/Budget-Minded Person`s room on the Eastside.

Housemate is moving out to live with his lovely girlfriend and I`m looking for some nice folks to rent his room. Couples preferred so as to cut down on the rent. This place is the business, no joke. Let me tell you a tale:\nLocation\nAdam`s Point. 10-15 minute walk to the 19th St. BART station. Burrito shop down the street. 10-15 minute walk to the Grand Lake Theatre area. Wicked farmer`s market on Saturdays. Equidistant to Whole Foods and Trader Joe`s. And of course Lake Merritt, the scenic gem of central Oakland.\nDetails and Amenities\nApartment highrise typical of the area, but a little bit taller than the rest of `em. 2 bedrooms. Separate bathrooms, how nice! Strange red heat lamps in each one (and normal lights, of course). Ridiculous amount of storage space. Unobstructed views of Lake Merritt (the whole damn thing!) from the living room. Grand Lake Theater and the Oakland Hills from the kitchen. Berkeley and Piedmont from the bedrooms. Balconies? We got `em! Gets some sweet sweet sunshine all day long. Warm in the winter, cool in the summer. Funky 60-ish interior. Washer and Dryers in the building. Parking space for 1 car (my housemate and I would trade off, worked pretty well). Mailboxes. Carpet on the walls of the elevators. A rad old lady who manages the building. What more could you ask for? Pets, you say? Sorry friend, how I wish it were so. (no pets. sorry.)\nMostly Furnished\nKitchenware. Couch. Chair(s). Bookshelves. A desk. Table(s). A wall clock. Toaster. Microwave.You`ll need your own bed. Pictures on the wall. No TVs allowed!\nThe Deal\nRent is $1300. Deposit is $750. Month to month. Utilities get split evenly (typical bills have been about $20 a month, total). Room for rent is the bigger of the two, space for a queen-sized no problem. Private attached bathroom. Internet is up and running, can`t remember how much off the top of my head but nothing outrageous.\nWho is this guy?\n29 year old typical white male varietal. Works in the City. Eats anything. Runs. Bikes. Climbs. Can grow a mean beard. Can wash a mean dish. Loves a good thrashing out in wilderness. Sleeps like a rock and/or the dead.\nWho are you guys?\nI really don`t care so long as your feets are on the ground, heads in the clouds, and hearts in the right place. Bonus points for bikes as primary means of transport. More bonus points if you have laugh wrinkles `round the eyes. No car? Ding ding we have a winner! (but it`s OK if you do. I`ve got one too.)\nAvailability\nLooking for a move-in at the end of August, but could do earlier potentially.\nSend me a text. Or an email. Tell me `bout your fine selves. Come and visit.

We have 1 unfurnished room available in a 4 bedroom, 3 bath house in the Sunnyside neighborhood. It`s a 3 month sublet with the *slight possibility of it turning into something more permanent. I`ll tell you more about that once we meet. Utilities are an additional $150/month. Available August 1st.\nAbout the house: It`s truly an amazing spot. Very spacious with a panoramic view to the south. Living room, dining room, family room, full (large) kitchen, laundry room and... it even has a backyard. Virtually no crime in this neighborhood. It`s a 15 minute walk to Bart... but why walk when you have two bus lines that will take you there. There`s a Safeway 3 blocks away and a Whole Foods 1.1 miles away. Ample street parking - no neighborhood decal required.\nAbout the living situation: You`ll be living with three male roommates, one male kitten and one female kitten -- two of the human housemates are in their late 30`s... and I just celebrated my 41st. We`re all busy bodies and try to maintain a good work/life balance. We believe in keeping the house tidy and peaceful. We have occasional dinner parties, BBQ`s and such but we generally partake in social events outside of the house. No late night parties at the house. You`ll be sharing your bathroom with one other housemate.\nWe`re open to both male and female candidates.\nNo need to send a lengthy essay, but in your response please tell me what you do for money, your hobbies (if you have any) and what you value in your domestic/living affairs.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"available": "aug 01", "dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "sfc", "bathrooms":
