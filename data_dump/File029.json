Enough space to fit a king size bed, a full size desk, dressers, night stands. Basically, I`ve seen apartments in New York the size of this living space. The bedroom has several dimensions (can`t measure it right now due to a tape measure that seemed to grow a pair of legs), but when I say big... I mean BIG. The first comment people make when they walk in is usually, \"Whoa!\"\nYes, the wall color is white, but you can paint it as you see fit. (Landlord will require you to repaint to the original color).\nThe walk-in closet is also huge. Not only does it feature 2 layers of hanging space, there`s even a little wrap around cubby that fits more storage and has an extra shelf. It`s like that little bonus storage you never knew existed! You also will have a couple of shoe racks left in the closet to use.\nThe bathroom is pretty spacious too. Standard shower tub, sink and toilet. There`s a built-in shelf and towel rack over the toilet, that I will leave. It also has a medicine cabinet and plenty of storage under the sink. Standard shower curtain and liner works.\nAbout the place.\nI have lived in various neighborhoods but can now say that I wouldn`t want to live anywhere else in Portland. The neighborhood is quiet (many neighbors keep to themselves) and off the main street (so even with Nike`s big sales, you don`t get a lot of noise). There`s never been any crime on the street since I`ve lived here. You can go for a run up through Irvington and look at the giant homes on a pretty flat stretch of sidewalk. On your bike, it`s a 10 minute ride to the heart of Alberta, N Williams, and maybe a 10-15 minute ride to Mississippi or the Pearl. You will love how centrally located you are for the price and what you get for your money.\nThe downstairs features wood floors (yes, that`s different from the pictures). It`s a cherry hue Pergo floor and looks nice with the current wall paint. There`s a gas fireplace, a back patio with gas grill, and even a little wine closet under the stairs (Or you could use it for additional storage). The kitchen is pretty standard. You have plenty of cabinet space for dishes, glassware, silverware, cookware and storage. There`s also a butler`s pantry for extra storage right next to the kitchen.\nDownstairs also features a half bath with a washer and dryer. The washer is an older model and works great. The dryer was replaced 2 years ago and hasn`t had any issues.\nThe townhome also features a garage. We used to house a car in there, but a previous tenant left a bunch of stuff behind (extra refrigerator and furniture that never got cleaned out), so it may be tough to fit a car in there, but there remains plenty of storage space.\nYou`ll be responsible for utilities (Cable, gas, electric) which runs about $120 a month. Every 3 months is the Portland Water & Sewer bill which will tack on about $100 to your bill. The landlord pays for trash service. Trash comes every other Tuesday. Recycling comes every Tuesday.\nI hope to start meeting potential housemates Sunday and Monday. The room will be available August 15 (there might be a few days wiggle room if necessary). Please send me an e-mail including a little about yourself, your schedule and when you might like to meet. I look forward to hearing from you!", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "mlt", "source_account": "q8sfd-4592544440@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "NE Knott", "source_state": "Oregon", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=45.542081&amp;lon=-122.659435&zoom=16", "source_loc": "portland", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@45.542081,-122.659435,16z", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Enormous bedroom and bath in NE townhouse!!!"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406613919, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410501919, "id": 1248653814, "price": 740.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-POR-POR", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-POR", "locality": "USA-POR-ELI", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-POR-MUL", "zipcode": "USA-97212", "long": "-122.659435", "county": "USA-OR-MUL", "state": "USA-OR", "lat": "45.542081", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01010_bhA2GBnaiF6_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00808_9qQaIgXNEcQ_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_hVNkYwyU18f_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01212_3gIZUlbKEQz_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01010_1pxPNd3bGTh_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_1xJTBYcR0Vo_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_aY0Xqdo3haR_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_7i8x6MyziEo_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01515_cazxT9LguVU_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_h4dBTWxTMd6_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_2t3Aza6ZPdr_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_ecIpxaeViA7_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_91AJ8LA8fDe_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592544440", "heading": "Enormous bedroom and bath in NE townhouse", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/roo/4592544440.html"}, {"body": "**Large private bedroom - JUST $469 - INCLUDING WATER and GAS and BI-WEEKLY CLEANER\n**Numerous closets\n**NEWLY REMODELED shared kitchen and bath\n**NEWER APPLIANCES: Dishwasher, garbage disposal, microwave and full-sized refrigerator in kitchen with large pantry\n**Mini-fridge in bedroom\n**Newer electrical, plumbing and heating systems\n**Newer thermal windows\n**Cleaning service cleans kitchen and bathroom every 2 weeks\n**Laundry\n**FREE PARKING: Off-street & well-lit\n**2 roommates are EMU students\n1/2 block to EMU\nQuick drive to U of M and WCC and Concordia\nShort walk to Depot Town and Downtown Ypsilanti restaurants\n*****AWARDED \"TOP RATED NATIONAL APARTMENT COMMUNITY\" in 2012 & 2013******\nby Apartment Ratings.Com - based on actual tenant ratings\nCited for:\n*** Excellent, fast maintenance staff on call 24/7\n*** Friendly, professional management team\nSee what people are saying about us: http://www.flo-mar.com/F-M/Reviews.html\nFLO-MAR APARTMENTS\nHours: M-F 10AM-5:00PM, or by appointment\nServing the Ypsilanti community Since 1967\nCheck out our Availabilities at: http://flo-mar.com/F-M/Availabilities.html", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406061003", "dogs": "NO", "source_account": "kbmb8-4582207457@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "phone": "7344832240", "cats": "NO", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "121 N.

Double-ish single available for $550!! Starting August 1st and ending in September (around the 25th). I say double-ish single because 1) I`ll be there til the 5th, 2) it`s totally furnished (not much room for your own furniture, but stuff can be moved around if needed), and 3) a roommate is kind of living there, kind of not. She doesn`t spend much time there but has some stuff there. So pretty much room to your own, but not much room to have a bunch of your own stuff. A twin bed is available, you`d just need your own bedding. Own bathroom, plenty of parking, laundry, beautiful views of parks, balcony (yup, we`re upstairs).

It features all hardwood floors, faux-granite countertops in the kitchen, a single bathroom with tile floors (no linoleum!), and coin-op laundry downstairs.

I`m not the cleanest person in the world, nor the messiest, and I wouldn`t expect you to be either. I don`t smoke, and really only drink at bars. I value my sleep, and quiet is kinda important to me, if only because I work in a very loud place.\nAbout you: You can be whatever age, whatever orientation, whatever gender, so long as you`ve got a steady income, don`t smoke, and don`t get too rowdy.\nAbout us: I`m not really looking for this to be a party place, but don`t let that discourage you from having overnight guests or close friends over. Maybe we can play boardgames or ride bikes together? If not, that`s cool too.\nPlease email me; I`m usually at work when all the 9-5ers are eating dinner and settling in for the night.

There`s laundry and dryer right outside the apartment. There`s also the apartment complex gym right by the unit, if you don`t have an ARC membership. Parking is provided a few feet away from the apartment unit. It is easily the most convenient place to live - for school, going to workout, meeting up with friends etc.\nI`m moving away, so you will have the option of keeping the drawer, desk + chair, and the queen size mattress if you want (or you can throw away and bring your own stuff). The room has two closets, one of those will be yours. The roommate is nice, considerate, and responsible so you won`t have a problem with any sharing issues.\nThe other housemates are considerate and nice as well, however they won`t be back until late August. They study and take school seriously, but do enjoy themselves during the weekdays. They won`t have music blasting all day, but on Friday or Saturday, they might have people over for a get together.

There`s laundry and dryer right outside the apartment. There`s also the apartment complex gym right by the unit, if you don`t have an ARC membership. Parking is provided a few feet away from the apartment unit. It is easily the most convenient place to live - for school, going to workout, meeting up with friends etc.\nI`m moving away, so you will have the option of keeping the drawer, desk + chair, and the queen size mattress if you want (or you can throw away and bring your own stuff). The room has two closets, one of those will be yours. The roommate is nice, considerate, and responsible so you won`t have a problem with any sharing issues.\nThe other housemates are considerate and nice as well, however they won`t be back until late August. They study and take school seriously, but do enjoy themselves during the weekdays. They won`t have music blasting all day, but on Friday or Saturday, they might have people over for a get together. They`re all chill guys, and easy to get along with.\nLet me know through text/phone or email if you`re interested in we can discuss any questions you have.

If you come in September 17th-21st, you`ll learn for yourself why this will be a start of your vacation tradition. Take all of the weekend or part of it because we dare you to stay just once.\nThe Western Whitehouse is a 3 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath bayfront home on 1 1/2 gated acres. The home offers ping pong, basketball, board games, video games, DVD and book libraries. The large paved driveway allows for easy access with two gates for ATV and boat trailers. BBQ on the deck in the sea air or hot tub in the solarium overlooking the bay. At night the lights on the water from the twin cities of Coos Bay and North Bend are an incredibly romantic sight.\nThe area offers restaurants with the freshest seafood you`ll ever find, a culinary college that`s open to the public, movie theaters, community plays, ATV`ing on the nearby dunes, fishing, crabbing, clamming and kayaking on the largest bay on the Oregon Coast. This part of Oregon is known at the Secret Coast, because of the unpopulated beaches. The world famous Bandon golf courses are a 20 minute drive away (12 courses within 40 minutes), while the Californian redwoods are a 2 hour drive. If you`re into visiting lighthouses, plan on checking off five in one day.
