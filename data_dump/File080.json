I am looking for a room/house mate and I will choose carefully. THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY for someone because it is total privacy, have lots of space ( you actually have a whole level of a house to yourself ) I am usually at work and any attention or company for my dog would be great. If you have a SMALL Dog - GREAT ! I like all dogs but would hope you have a small one. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR JUST A FEW MONTHS - THAT IS FINE ! I am ok with someone who does not know if they are going to stay or know that it is for short term\nI am looking for someone down to earth - as I am and someone who I can be comfortable with. I hope you read that last statement, because I will only choose someone who I feel good about. It is that simple!!!!!. Most people usually understand and appreciate that. We will have to share utilities.\nTHIS IS FOR ONE PERSON. I am not flexible on this one- so if you have a girl friend or boy friend who would be over all the time, this is not it. There are many other things I would consider, but not on this one. No, I would not be into your business at all. I don`t care what you are into ! The reason for that last one with a spouse is that it then becomes a 3 party house - no matter what and there is no 3 rd room mate. This is s a little house in a quiet neighborhood. I hope to find someone who wants privacy. EVERONE WHO HAS COME TO LOOK IN THE PAST, HAS LIKED IT AND USUALLY wants to take the opportunity but please understand that I will choose carefully.\nThis a GREAT LOCATION. It is 3 minutes from the Greenbelt Metro. I can hear the train operator`s words when the train leaves the station !!! The street going to the Metro is well lit and you are a stone throw from UMD. I want to be comfortable in my own house. Just be a nice person ! (eventhough we may not have much contact, I wan t to make sure that we.... well, feel comfy around each other )\nOh, the money is flexible - it depends on what we agree on - and some other factors. If you need more than one room and have lots of stuff .... I have either another room to help you with that or in the basement. The current person is leaving after staying here for a short term period. ( I choose her because she only needed to stay for a short term ) Yes, I choosy but I tell you that i am down to earth and just know what I am comfortable with and being upfront is best. If you are ok with this, call\n show contact info", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406120723", "available": "jul 23", "dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "mld", "source_account": "j87bg-4583115048@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "private_room": "YES", "no_private_bath": "YES", "sqft": "1200", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "College Park, Berwyn Heights, Greenbelt, MD", "source_state": "District of Columbia", "phone": "2028174830", "source_loc": "washingtondc", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@38.996300,-76.929900,16z", "off_street_parking": "YES", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=38.996300&amp;lon=-76.929900&zoom=16", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "cats": "YES", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Room ( whole level of house )RIGHT across from Metro station!

Situated on Vineyard Sound with unbelievable views of Martha`s Vineyard, Nobska Lighthouse, and Falmouth Heights, our home has a private sandy beach and the summer swimming is without equal.\nThe house is bordered on one side by the ocean and on the other by a private dirt road that runs parallel to the readily accessible Shining Sea Bikeway. It`s about 2.5 miles to downtown Falmouth, and a one mile leisurely stroll down the bike path and along Little Harbor to downtown Woods Hole: still franchise-free with quaint buildings, coffee shops, the ferry to Martha`s Vineyard, an aquarium and information centers for a scientific community hosting the Marine Biological Laboratories and the Oceanographic Institution", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"bathrooms": "5.5ba", "source_account": "mqmdx-4588226763@hous.craigslist.org", "furnished": "YES", "house": "YES", "source_neighborhood": "Falmouth", "year": "1927", "original_posting_date": "1406386476", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@41.526300,-70.664300,16z", "dogs": "YES", "source_heading": "LARGE WATERFRONT HOME&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;10BR&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(((20 SLEEP", "available": "jul 26", "bedrooms": "8br", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=41.526300&amp;lon=-70.664300&zoom=16", "source_loc": "capecod", "attached_garage": "YES", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_continent": "USA", "wheelchair_accessible": "YES", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "source_subcat": "vac", "cats": "YES"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406634064, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410522064, "id": 1249244992, "price": 4200.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-BAS-WOO", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-BAS", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-02543", "long": "-70.6643", "county": "USA-MA-BAR", "state": "USA-MA", "lat": "41.5263", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_iXn4aNDhsp_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_kylTo6Z3beb_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01515_6vj2rVuaQvS_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01313_9DaMb6lW16o_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_lieqzmHZbV4_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01717_1xw4bwEJhzY_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_5dAL5lynxgK_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_6WxlFRCmsDY_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_llKUEVG7xFu_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_ipBUUMgcXRS_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_7yB0ckJSwUy_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01616_i5MlfVrkWXn_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_gD8BwsHhPmL_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_36AahYE7IQb_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_Viemiut9xj_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_hdf80eIDIxJ_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01616_d84NwDTnaW0_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_9HmRiHSldsv_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01313_hpO8P7BRJPS_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_j0GqxrkPVfp_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_5DguLOLiwla_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_81atEzN9PfK_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01515_gGdhca5XbHx_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4588226763", "heading": "LARGE WATERFRONT HOMEgt;gt;gt;gt;gt;10BRgt;gt;gt;gt;gt;gt;20 SLEEP", "category": "RVAC", "external_url": "http://capecod.craigslist.org/vac/4588226763.html"}, {"body": "ID: 1514494\nLocation: Putnam, CambridgeRent: $2750 / Month\nBroker Fee: One Month\nAvailable Date: NOW\nBeds: 2\nBaths: 1\nFeatures: Parking Included\nThomas Devine\n show contact info\n show contact info\nPoint Plus\n33 Church Street, Cambridge, MA 02138\n show contact info\n show contact info\n(Fax)\nhttp://www.pointplus.com\nPictures may be of model units.
