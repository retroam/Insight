If you move in this week, I`ll still only charge for August. It`s a great spot, check it out:\nAbout the place:\nGlen park is a sweet area with awesome restaurants, grocery/convenience stores, parks, and public transportation all with easy access. Getting on 280 or 101 N/S is a breeze with almost no traffic before getting on the highway. Parking on the block is easy. The apartment is part of a three-family building and has (free) laundry machines and a private outdoor space in back. The apartment has one bathroom, a small-but-functional kitchen, and a nice comfortable living room. I keep the place very neat and deep clean every couple weeks. WiFi and utilities are on me, just need someone to cover rent. 4/20 friendly.\nThe Room:\nPartially furnished (bed w/ new mattress, but nothing else), empty closet with lot`s of space. Great bay windows!\nAbout me:\nMy name is Seth, I`m a 24 y/o male, working at an ad tech company down in San Carlos. I work during the day and frequent the climbing gym after work. I spend a lot of time outside and with my friends. I love music, exercise, art, thinking, philosophy and psychology, business, and conversing about just about anything. With a roommate, I`m down to hang out in the evenings when home, but I`m more than happy to keep to myself as well. I`ll be going away the first weekend of August and leaving to visit Peru right towards the end of the month, so you`ll have some weekends to yourself. August 9th is Outside Lands and my birthday so I`ll probably be out and about a lot that weekend as well (but no parties or anything happening here). If you`re new to the area I`m happy to help you find your way around.\nContact me:\nVia email through craigslist. Questions are welcome, and if you`re interested in the place, I`d love for you to include a little about yourself - age, interests, occupation/current primary activities, reason for stay/time in SF. I`m not too picky, it`s just a month sublet, being neat/clean, independent, respectful, and responsible are my only real criteria.\nThanks!", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406605116", "available": "jul 29", "dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "sfc", "source_account": "6fnf4-4592444737@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "cats": "NO", "bedrooms": "2br", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "glen park", "source_state": "California", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=37.731727&amp;lon=-122.441640&zoom=16", "source_loc": "sfbay", "apartment": "YES", "street_parking": "YES", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@37.731727,-122.441640,16z", "source_subcat": "sub", "source_heading": "$1200 August Room Sublet;

House is 2000 square feet. Big back yard with fire pit and hot tub (being repaired). Separate building with stage/venue for music. Many of the people who gather here are musicians. Have been hosting music shows most weekends. Can also watch movies on projector screen in the venue if I have time to set it up. 5 minutes by car to downtown Lacey and Olympia, a little longer to Tumwater. Bus within easy walking distance. Bike lanes on nearest arterial and bike trail a short distance away. There is vegetable gardening space available and also a chicken coop in need of some repair.\nI am a 55 year old straight male who owns the house. We are LBGT friendly and tolerate weed, alcohol, and non-sexual nudity, and expect all who live here to have the same tolerance. Hard drugs like meth or heroin not allowed. Friends who are hard drug dealers and users are not welcome. Tobacco only allowed outside.\nPlease have a reliable source of income. Work-for-rent arrangement not available. Cleanliness and tidiness are critical, especially in kitchen and bathrooms (please don`t apply if you don`t have a habit of immediately cleaning up after yourself). There is no storage space on property so all of your belongings must fit in your room. There is space in the dining room to work on light, non-messy projects (such as school work), but because this is a shared area please coordinate this activity with other residents and all of your belongings must be completely removed when you leave the room for much time. The kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom must be kept clean and be cleared out when you are done for other residents to use. There is no charge for utilities, though excessive use of laundry room is discouraged. You must provide food for yourself and your guests. Quiet time is anything that ends with AM with exceptions if arranged in advance. No pets. Residents are expected to not leave messes, clutter, track in mud, hoard dirty dishes in your room, you know, just be a good roommate.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"available": "aug 01", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_subloc": "oly", "no_smoking": "YES", "source_account": "wcbhs-4592469211@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "private_room": "YES", "no_private_bath": "YES", "sqft": "110", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "East Olympia", "source_state": "Washington", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=47.032465&amp;lon=-122.865398&zoom=16", "source_loc": "seattle", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@47.032465,-122.865398,16z", "off_street_parking": "YES", "year": "2000", "cats": "NO", "dogs": "NO", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Secluded location - convenient access"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406606772, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410494772, "id": 1248370878, "price": 400.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SEA-OLM", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-SEA", "locality": "USA-SEA-IDI", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SEA-OLY", "zipcode": "USA-98501", "long": "-122.865398", "county": "USA-WA-THU", "state": "USA-WA", "lat": "47.032465", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_cBEWPl5w4Fo_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592469211", "heading": "Secluded location - convenient access", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://seattle.craigslist.org/oly/roo/4592469211.html"}, {"body": "1,532 sqft. $ 2,298.\nAlfa One Investments\nPlaza De Flores\n5924 Los Angles Ave Simi Valley CA 93063\nGrand floor retail. two spaces can be rented together or separately.\nA lot of parking and a very good location.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406606774", "dogs": "NO", "source_account": "9gcz4-4592469248@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "phone": "8187186930", "cats": "NO", "sqft": "1532", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "5924 Los Angles Ave Simi Valley", "source_state": "California", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=34.304600&amp;lon=-118.684400&zoom=16", "source_loc": "ventura", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@34.304600,-118.684400,16z", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_subcat": "off", "source_heading": "GRAND FLOOR RETAIL SPACE"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406606775, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410494775, "id": 1248543422, "price": 2298.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-LAX-SIM", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-LAX", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-93063", "long": "-118.6844", "county": "USA-CA-VEN", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "34.3046", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592469248", "heading": "GRAND FLOOR RETAIL SPACE", "category": "RCRE", "external_url": "http://ventura.craigslist.org/off/4592469248.html"}, {"body": "Room for Rent $500 month utilities not included\n$300 deposit due at move in.\nAvailable ASAP\nClose to Riverside Plaza, RCC & UCR.\nNo pets allowed.\nPlease call or text 9five1-75six-27five7", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"source_account": "nz5vc-4592469273@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "phone": "9517562757", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_state": "California", "dogs": "NO", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=33.931500&amp;lon=-117.411900&zoom=16", "source_loc": "inlandempire", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@33.931500,-117.411900,16z", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Room for Rent $500 month"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406606776, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410494776, "id": 1248364342, "price": 500.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-LAX-RIV", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-LAX", "locality": "USA-LAX-PRE", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-92504", "long": "-117.4119", "county": "USA-CA-RIE", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "33.9315", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00404_iqCEnFCFYj6_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_5vWV9uUQb6O_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_cZ8ucadlhlI_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592469273", "heading": "Room for Rent $500 month", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://inlandempire.craigslist.org/roo/4592469273.html"}, {"body": "Availability from Fri Aug 1st to Fri Aug 8th\nThis is a lakeside 1bd/1bth condo that sleep 4 people - with a kitchen and living room with a pull out couch bed.\n$1,200 for the whole week.

The rent is 425.00/month -- utilities included which are; water, electric, gas, and internet.\nThe house is 1500 sq feet. Fully furnished except for the available bedroom. It is split level with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. House is very spacious with a living room and a family room. It also gets a lot of sunlight and has a lot of character. Hardwoods and linoleum tile throughout- no carpet. A large backyard with a small patio. If you like to garden there are some great areas to start a garden. I have a shed in the backyard which has been great for storing a bike and or camping gear. The house is right near the greenway and is also approximately 4 miles from downtown.\nI am 40 years old, female, lesbian, so whoever moves in must be LGBT friendly.\nI have two cats, and my current roommate has one cat. We are both responsible for our cats and clean up after them and care for them. Whoever moves in has to be ok with cats. You do not have to be their best friend but please know that they are part of the household.\nI am very laid back, good sense of humor, responsible, considerate, and neat. I am not OCD but like the place to be kept up. I drink socially; therefore you must be ok with that. I work full time at a hospital. 10 hour shifts four days a week from 11am-9pm. In my spare time I enjoy being outdoors as much as possible such as running, hiking, biking etc. I have an active social life and am rarely home. When I am home I clean, cook, do yard work, or just relax with a movie.\nMy other roommate is 34 years old, female. She works 9-5 Monday through Friday. She is laid back, good sense of humor, enjoys photography, board games, and cooking.\nWe are both drama free. Please be drama free as well.\nI am looking for a housemate who is RESPONSIBLE, respectful, laid back; a good sense of humor would be welcomed. Someone who cleans up after themselves is a must, and chips in with some of the basic chores in the common areas would be nice too.\nSorry no kids, and unfortunately no pets.. We are maxed out here.

The place features hardwood floors is very big at 1,400 sq ft. It includes a large living room, a dining room, a kitchen with appliances, two bathrooms with showers and two bedrooms. You`d be renting one of the bedrooms as well as a bathroom.\nThe room is very spacious.

All in all, your rent + utilities would never be more than $1,000 per month. There is also no lease; it`s month to month. As I said above, the room is available Sept. 1, but you may be able to move in earlier than that.\nYour roommate (aka me) is a 24-year-old dude who I hear is pretty cool. I work as a reporter, and I love to hang out in my living room watch music videos while drinking a cold one. I like to go for a run every now and then, but I really enjoy reading books, comics as well as watching movies and TV shows on Netflix. I`m also the kind of guy who likes to go out on the weekend and throw a house party every couple of months.\nThere`s also a good chance that I will be moving my dog into the apartment. He`s a very friendly and loyal small black labrador/cocker spaniel mix.\nI`m looking for someone who I will not only get along with but also become friends with. Please only apply if:\n- You`re between the ages of 21 and 28\n- You`re social and like doing fun things\n- You have a steady job\n- You like dogs\nIf you`re interested and fit the criteria, shoot me an email and we can set up a time to chat/meet/tour the place, all those things.
