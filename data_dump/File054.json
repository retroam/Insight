I like to price the condo low and keep it full. Hotels on this street are charging $179/night for a tiny room with no kitchen, and no view. I have had a few people cancel their reservations at their hotel to come stay here. I like to keep the condo in a condition that will guarantee EVERY guest will have positive comments. Rate is based on double occupancy.

The condo was\nclean and had everything we needed. Free\nparking was great as was proximity to\nthe beach and shops. The bed was large\nand very comfy also. Glad we stayed\nhere!\nTim and Gina, Tulare, CA\n06/03/13 Positive My landlord Emmanuel is fabulous. Emmanuel is very accommodating (yes - pardon the pun) and takes his responsibilities as landlord very seriously. I stayed in Emmanuel`s condo for 10 nights and it is what everyone and Emmanuel says about it. Incredibly clean, plenty of space, good position (really close to the Hilton Hawaiian Village - which is on the beach) close to shops restaurants, great internet and I really appreciated the downloaded movies. I`m not sure that it is possible to get the same amenities at that price anywhere else in Waikiki. Emmanuel was really prompt at refunding the security deposit and he is generally an all round nice guy. Hope to see you again one day. Gina PS - there is the most fabulous massage/spa place just around the corner - ZENZA - true nail artisans.\nGina, Melbourne, Australia\n04/19/13 Positive We visit Hawaii several times a year,\nand prefer to rent condos. We recently\nhad the pleasure of renting Emmanuel`s\none bedroom condo at 1911 Kalakaua Ave.\nWe rent a car, and don`t normally spend\na lot of time in Waikiki, so this\nlocation was very convenient. The unit\nwas super clean,comfortable, and you\ncan`t beat free parking. It`s an easy\nwalk to the Hilton Hawaiian Village, and\nalso close to the convention center and\nAla Moana.\nAnonymous, Seattle/Washington\n04/07/13 Positive I really enjoy staying in this apartment with my kids!\nThe place is nice and clean with a lot of amenities, very\nclose to the beach and shopping.

Emmanuel is very\ninsightful as to guiding us to places to\nvisit and see. He loaded the computer\nwith movies for down time. I don`t think\nyou will find a hotel with that amount\nof square feet - with the amenities he\noffers \"the comforts of home\" for the\nprice he offers. well worth the price,\nclean and great location ;O) Aloha...\nplus; parking is included which you will\nbe grateful for, parking is a burden and\nhotels charge daily rates but this\nprivilege is included in the package.\ngarret, SD, CA\n08/25/12 Positive Excellent location!!! Very centrally located. Free\nparking was a nice bonus. The condo was well\nkept and clean. Emmanuel is super easy to deal\nwith. He is very quick to reply to any concerns or\nquestions. Our security deposit is already being\nsent as we are still at the airport. Free WIFI is\nvery nice. This place is highly recommended for\nanyone staying in Waikiki. Thanks Emmanuel for\nmaking our visit so pleasant!!\nMarie and Johnny, Edmonton, AB\n06/25/12 Positive We (myself and two other colleagues) recently stayed in Emmanuel`s superb self-catering condo while attending an international conference at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The condo is very conveniently located--it was just a short 5 minute stroll to the conference venue. The beach was very easily accessible, as were restaurants and shops. It is also very reasonably priced, much less expensive than the Hilton, for example, especially when you factor in the savings associated with being able to prepare your own meals. We were pleased that the condo was in such great shape--everything was exceptionally clean and well kept. It was a nice place to work in, with a good computer and internet access, and very close to a caf\u00c3\u00a9 with a lovely outdoor patio and free wifi. It was easy to meet with Emmanuel upon arrival and checkout. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Honolulu, and would certainly stay here again.\nMartin French, Queen`s University, Canada\n05/14/12 Positive We had four adults and two children stay six nights in the condo and our stay was very comfortable and fit all our needs. The condo owner, Emmanuel, was very nice and made sure all of our needs were taken care of. If you are looking to spend time in Waikiki the location is perfect.\nJames, Ketchikan, AK\n05/10/12 Positive Highly recommended. The place was immaculate. Manny admires cleanliness and so do I. Location was perfect, on Kalakaua Ave., between the strip and the mall. As you exit the front door, to your right is an ABC store and the left a 7-11. You can`t get more convenient than that. You are a stroll away from the beach. Access was easy. Parking, I would suggest a compact car. It`s a bit of a squeeze. Pics were accurate. Owner was very accommodating. All in all 5/5.\nJeffrey L., South San Francisco, CA\n04/15/12 Positive We stayed at Emmanuel`s condo at Kalakaua Ave for 9 days from April 4 to April 13. The condo is equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Emmanuel makes sure that all his customers use his condo clean and takes great care of his unit. He also provides lots of towels to make your stay by the beach carefree and clean. From the condo, it is a very short walk to Hilton Hawaiian Village right at the beach, so don`t miss to go out on a nice post dinner walk and check out their Friday night fireworks!(It is supposed to be for about 10 minutes starting 7:45PM, but give yourself a little extra time as they could start it a little earlier) My two young boys (11 and 8) each got to have his own bed (couch bed and futon bed) to sleep and to call his base. The king size bed at the bedroom was very comfortable and we slept very well. We also watched some movies Emmanuel had on his TV including \"Decendants\",\"Slumdog Millionaire\" and \"Kickass\". Pretty nice selections! Thank you, Manny, for making us feel welcome and helped us have wonderful vacation.\nEri Hoshina, Concord, CA\n02/08/12 Positive This condo is a little gem ! We stayed for 8 days. It is perfect for two people. All the comforts of home. A nice little walk to the beach, shops, restaurants. We would definitely recommend this place, and we would stay again ! Thanks so much.\nKim, Sacramento CA\n02/02/12 Positive The host was most helpful and \"down home\" friendly. The apartment was CLEAN!! I walked around for a whole day in my WHITE sox. They were still white when I went to bed that night. Now that is clean. That was a very positive week. Thanks\nChuck & Jane Irwin, Fresno, California\n07/25/11 Positive This condo was so well located that we only rented a car for 2 of the 7 days to go to the Arizona Memorial and the North Shore. Parking was great as we rented a Smart Car that fit well. (Warning, do not rent from the Smart Car rental just down the street, we had a big problem with the owner over a tiny ding on the car acquired in another lot and the owner wanted to charge \"out of service\" fees until the car went into the shop as if the car couldn`t be driven with a paint ding.) The free Internet access was a huge plus as I uploaded vacation pics to FB every evening. Emmanuel Chen was such a sincere owner, wanting us to have a positive experience and very enthusiastic about the condo and Waikiki. He was easily accessible before and during our stay. He was very quick to return our deposit. The price was right.. There are so many free things to do right on the beach...fireworks on Friday nights by the marina and Movies on Queen`s Beach. The Ukelele Festival was amazing and free with international musicians, hula, and food vendors. That too was within walking distance. The close free attractions add to the affordability. Plenty of nice big towels provided, a very comfortable and large bed as well. Very well equipped kitchen. Paper goods aren`t included but easily picked up across the street at the very friendly Kuhio Pharmacy. I would recommend to friends and family.\nNancy Kidd, Arrowsic, Maine\n07/08/11 Positive Wow. . .what a great deal, book this VRBO with confidence, Mr.Chen has nailed this one! These reviews are spot on; secure parking, premises immaculate through out, Hi-speed internet access, close to the beach, great location convenient stroll to Waikiki shopping and restaurants. As a bonus, Mr.Chen shared knowledge of the islands local eateries & shopping, saved my spouse and I mucho $$. 06/21/11-06/28/11 Mahalo\nAnonymous, Atlanta/Georgia\n06/08/11 Positive Very nice little condo only a few blocks from the beach, Hilton`s Hawaiian Village, Ala Moana park and the mall. It`s on the main drag (Kalakaua Ave.) right into the heart of Waikiki. Our family stayed there for 7 days and Emmanuel made us feel VERY welcome! There was enough room for our three boys and the kitchen was great for making meals when we wanted to save money and not eat out. Thanks, Emmanuel!\nJohn C., Parker, CO\n05/31/11 Positive What a great deal and excellent location to get your Island swagger on! Emmanuel`s condo is super clean, and it`s a great home-from-home, right in downtown Honolulu. It`s an easy walk to Waikiki Beach and to all the cool shops and restaurants, including the incomparable Duke`s. Rent this condo and you also get free, secure parking, a bonus worth $25 to $50 per day. Finally, you`ve got a great landlord in Emmanuel \"Manny\" Chen. He`ll make sure your stay is island rock solid! Enjoy!\nMark, Eagle River, Alaska\n03/27/11 Positive We had a great stay in Emmanuel`s condo\nin spite of the tsunami.We found that\neverything we saw in the condo`s website\nwas was very accurate and that\nEmmanuel was a hospitable and helpful\nowner.\nWe would recommend this condo to our\nfriends\nBruce Allan, Toronto Canada\n01/28/11 Positive This has to have been the cleanest condo that I have ever stayed at. The two of us made the best of it and both agreed that every thing in it was Great. The walking to the beach and restaurants are very close. The owner was honest and just a nice person to talk to and feel good once all questions were answered.\nJohn, San Diego, CA\n10/18/10 Positive Location, location, location - there isn`t a better place to stay in Waikiki. If you plan on staying in the Honolulu/Waikiki area, don`t even bother renting a car because EVERYTHING (shopping, dining, beaches, convenience stores, public trans, rental shops, other hotels, tourist attractions, etc.) is within close walking distance from Emmanuel`s condo - literally \"down the street\". I rented both a bicycle (beach cruiser) & car (Nissa Sentra), so the free garage parking & convenient street bike racks were a major plus. The garage space is a bit tight but I fit just fine next to a huge SUV thanks to my San Francisco parking skills lol. There are also many bus stops across the streets, & the easy-to-navigate bus ride to the airport took less than an hour during a busy afternoon. Emmanuel was always prompt & thorough responding to all my concerns, & he even allowed me to check-in SUPER early which was great because down the street at the Hilton, where I was staying at first, did not have free internet access so I ended up checking out of there early & staying at his condo instead. The place is, of course, very clean & Emmanuel does insist it stay that way so he can return the deposit, which he did so fast I had just barely left the airport after my trip to Hawaii. It is noisy outside but you don`t hear any of that noise if you close the doors of course! Anyway, it was MUCH quieter than the Hilton, where I was rudely awakened at sunrise everyday (until I checked-in to the condo) by angry hotel employees on strike.

We are looking for a down-to-earth person to share the house with two gay men (couple).\nThe house is a lived-in home and is very comfortable & casual. There are hardwood floors throughout except the kitchen and bathroom, which are tiled. The home is in an area that is being renovated and is a safe neighborhood.\nThere is a corner bodega for food and beverages, a corner bodega that serves mostly beer a mini grocery store around the corner on Wharton and a take out Chinese place around the corner. Across from the Chinese place is one of two local laundromats.\nThe 2 bus line runs southbound in front of the house and northbound on 16th street. It is just a short walk to Broad Street to catch the C bus or jump on the Broad Street Subway line.\nWe do not live in a show place and we are not looking for someone that is a clean freak. If the dishes stay in the dirty dishes basin overnight, so be it. We do ask that the new roommate help keep the public areas orderly since we all will share them. We tend to spend most of our time at home in our bedrooms with occasional use of the living room to watch tv. Having friends or dates over is not a problem. Life has it own set of stresses but our home situation should not be an added one for any of us.\nThe middle bedroom on the second floor has one window with hardwood floors. Unfortunately, I do not have any current photos of the middle bedroom.\nSmoking is allowed in the bedrooms and outside but not in the public areas.\nSorry, no pets are allowed.\nRent for each room is $425 per month. The rent fee includes the electric, gas, wifi internet and there is X1 DVR cable tv in the living room. If cable in the bedroom is wanted, there will be an additional $10 a month fee for the X1 cable box rental and taxes. There is a sixth month roommate lease and to move in a deposit of $425 plus first month`s rent will be due. Longer leases or month to month are available after the first 6 months.\nThere is the potential for a reduction ($75 per month) in rent in exchange for very light cleaning of the public areas of the house (kitchen, bathroom, living room and dining room). Reduction does not apply to the first month.\nIf you are a down-to-earth person that feels you would enjoy living in our casual comfortable home, please send us an email through the email link above telling us a bit about yourself.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1405275148", "dogs": "NO", "source_account": "tzsbh-4567047351@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_state": "Pennsylvania", "source_neighborhood": "South 17th between Wharton and Reed", "source_loc": "philadelphia", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Looking for Gay/Gay-Friendly Roomie in South Philly"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406628724, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410516724, "id": 1249277419, "price": 425.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-PHI-PHI", "geolocation_status": 5, "metro": "USA-PHI", "locality": "USA-PHI-CIW", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-19102", "long": "-75.16379", "county": "USA-PA-PHI", "state": "USA-PA", "lat": "39.95233", "formatted_address": "Philadelphia, PA, USA", "accuracy": 7}, "images": [], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4567047351", "heading": "Looking for Gay/Gay-Friendly Roomie in South Philly", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://philadelphia.craigslist.org/roo/4567047351.html"}, {"body": "I`m looking for a roommate at the of August.

DISCOUNT LIFT TICKETS AND SKI RENTALS.Greystone Lodge is located at the base of Blackcomb Mountain next to the Wizard Express and Magic Chair lifts. A boutique style condo complex with only 50 units makes Greystone Lodge one of the smaller vacation rental locations in the Benchlands neighbourhood in Whistler. Condos are bright and spacious, something unique to Greystone Lodge. The fourty foot windows of the lofted units gives Greystone Lodge its stunning appearance for passer`s by and great mountain views for guests that occupy them. GREYSTONE LODGE AMENITIES For relaxation and convenience guests of Greystone Lodge will find an outdoor heated pool and hot tub along with an indoor hot tub, showers, and common area washrooms. There is a coin operated laundry facility in the building as well as a vending machine for quick snacks. Unique to Greystone Lodge is free underground parking, something hard to come by in Whistler. Guests should be warned that the underground parking has a total height limit of 6 feet 8 inches. Large SUV`s with ski racks may not fit in the underground and there is very limited over-height parking at the lodge. LOCAL AMENITIES Within a very short walking distance guests will find ski school, ski and snowboard rentals, bike rentals, restaurants, a liquor store, a small grocery store and various retail outlets. The walk to the main Whistler Village will take around 7-10 minutes on foot, however, a village transit bus comes every 7 minutes in the Winter and every 15 minutes during the other months.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1405645949", "available": "aug 17", "dogs": "NO", "bathrooms": "2ba", "source_account": "6rzcp-4574467879@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "Canada", "phone": "6142541342", "cats": "NO", "bedrooms": "2br", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "whistler", "source_state": "British Columbia", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=%32%31%36%2D%34%39%30%35+Spearhead+Place&amp;csz=Whistler+BC&amp;country=CA", "source_loc": "whistler", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+%32%31%36%2D%34%39%30%35+Spearhead+Place+Whistler+BC+CA", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "condo": "YES", "source_subcat": "vac", "source_heading": "**2 Bedroom Ski-In Out Whistler Accommodation Greystone** "}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406628838, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410516838, "id": 1249278336, "price": 190.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"geolocation_status": 3, "country": "CAN", "long": "-122.94997", "state": "CAN-BC", "lat": "50.113258", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4574467879", "heading": "2 Bedroom Ski-In Out Whistler Accommodation Greystone", "category": "RVAC", "external_url": "http://whistler.craigslist.ca/vac/4574467879.html"}, {"body": "Modern.
