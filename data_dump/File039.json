The spacious living area, with its cathedral ceiling, skylights, and picture windows, frame the lake and landscape.\nBelow are direct quotes from paying guests.\n********************************************************************\nWe had a wonderful time at Moosetracks. It was lovlier than we had\nanticipated! The loft was beautiful and the cottage exuded warmth.\nIt felt so much like the way we view \"Maine\" and we were so sorry to\nleave. We actually were going to leave late on Friday night to avoid\nthe Massachusetts Turnpike traffic, but decided to stay over, and\nface the next day`s traffic because it was so hard parting with that\npiece of heaven!\nThe lake, the cottage, the silence!, the trees, blueberries, fresh\nwater spring, fishing, canoes, and kayak were, in combination, almost\nmore than we deserved!\nI can honestly say that this was the nicest cottage we have been to\nin Maine and we have been visiting different areas every summer in\nMaine for years, each time renting cottages (rarely renting the same\none twice).\nWe met one of your neighbor`s who used to vacation in the area often\nand loved it so much that they decided to buy there!\nThank you for allowing us the opportunity to visit Moosetracks. Best\nRegards,\n********************************************************************\nAnother guest said:\nWe really enjoyed our stay at your beautiful cabin. It was\nlike being in the Hilton of cabins.We explored an awful lot and the\ncabin was a perfect jump off point. Jimmy had concerns about\ndrinking the mountain water and suggests that you let everyone know\nto pick up water if they aren`t comfortable with drinking the water\nout of the spring. The paddle boat was a blast and the fishing was\npretty good too. Jimmy caught 5 pickerel and 1 bass. We navigated\nthe blueberry barrens with a GPS and a map from Rt. 1 to Rt. 9,\nvisited Lubec and Campobello, Bar Harbor, Acadia and the coast around\nColumbia and Milbridge. The weather couldn`t have been better. You\nhave a piece of heaven up there. Thanks for sharing it with us.\nAMENITIES\nYou will find satellite TV, linens for a queen, a double, a twin bed and a sofa,and towels, telephones (local calls only), Sega Genesis video game system with games, VCR and several videos, and a boombox.\nThere is a desk for writing or business, a cozy family room, and three ceiling fans that help moderate the temperature.\nFor your outdoor enjoyment we have a barbeque, fire pit, lake frontage, dock, fishing poles, 2 canoes, 2 kayaks, a paddleboat, and life jackets. Please be careful and always wear life jackets while on the water. You assume many risks when using the boats. DO NOT LEAVE CHILDREN UNATTENDED.\nWe have a fresh water spring located close by. It will provide you the very best drinking water money can buy-except it`s free. The store down the street has bottled water if you`d rather have bottled water.\nACTIVITIES AND ATTRACTIONS\nVisit year round to enjoy the canoeing, kayaking, photography, bird watching, swimming, animals, hiking, lake view, hunting, fishing, rafting, skating, skiing, and snowmobiling. Enjoy the views from every window and the balcony.\nYour nearest neighbors will be the blueberries, loons, eagles, moose, deer, beaver, and plenty more wildlife.\nThe cabin is located 35 minutes East of Bangor, 45 minutes from Acadia National Park, 45 miles from Canada, and 20 miles from the Atlantic. It`s a short drive to the quaint villages of Cherryfield and Milbridge. There is a market 2 miles away for food, goodies, or bait and tackle.\nVACATION RENTAL RATES\nApril 1 - October 31:\n Weekly: $700\nNovember 1 - March 31:\n Monthly: $2000\nPets possible $50/week\nTo make and hold a reservation, a down payment of 50%, plus a $300\nsecurity deposit will be required once you receive confirmation from\nme of availability via phone or email.

We are two amazing roommates who are currently looking to replace our wonderful third roommate who is moving out at the end of August.\nABOUT US:\nCHRISTOS is a 37 year old software startup nerd. He relocated here from Boston this past summer to get into the startup community here (original, right?). He`s big into Crossfit, cooking, snowboarding in the winter, and boating in the summer . He is the official house cook and gardener and loves exploring the city with his black lab Bella. His gardening skills are still being refined. So far, he has mastered the art of growing dirt. Christos originally grew up in NJ and always keeps the house flowing full of dance/house music when nobody is home.Christos spends most of the week at work and working out. When he is home, he likes to catch up on Jeopardy! on the dvr, root for Boston sports teams and give Pearl brilliant dating advice.\nPEARL is a 37 year old acupuncturist. She recently relocated from Garberville, a few hours north of the city to explore city life. Pearl loves the outdoors, being active, doing yoga, and forcing Christos to reduce, reuse, recycle, and use chemical-free cleaning supplies. Pearl is still new to the concept of traffic, rush hour, cars, and traffic patterns not found in the boonies. But she is quickly learning what it all means and how to manage it. She has gotten into only two car accidents in since getting her new car is April. Pearl`s schedule is somewhat flexible. When she is home, she enjoys to meditate, explore the neighborhood and ignore Christos` terrible dating advice.\nBELLA is Christos` 9 year old dog. She is primarily a German Shorthaired Pointer but she looks like a lab. She is very friendly with humans, but when it comes to dogs. She is an alpha female and she is the BOSS! However, she gets along great with male dogs pretty well. Bella gets walked every day and spends 95% of her time day dreaming about Christos.\nWe both are dog lovers, single(ish), and have no kids. We still like to go out and have fun, drink wine, explore the city and make new friends. We spend our nights at home, sharing dating disaster stories, going to pub trivia night, or just hanging out. We would like a roommate who is open-minded, likes to have fun, and meet new people.\nThis person should also be mature, have some security to pay rent and bills on time, and be able to live in a community-type household. We shop for each other, cook for each other, and clean up with each other and we all pitch in.\nWe are open to a roommate with a well-behaved dog as well. Ideally male as Bella is an alpha.\nABOUT THE HOUSE:\nOur house is a 3 Bed/1.5 Bath on Texas Street in Potrero Hill. Here are some of the features:\n- Modern kitchen with gas stove\n- Washer Dryer\n- Right next to Caltrain.\n- Big backyard with furniture and grill\n- Tandem parking in our garage but ample street parking\n- LOTS of storage room downstairs in the garage.\n- Two amazing roommates\nThe room is about 11`x 13` and the house has basic furnishings but the room is empty. So all you would need is a bed and whatever you want in your room.\nIf you sound like you might be a fit, we`d love to hear more. We`d appreciate a little bit of information about you", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406618483", "source_subloc": "sfc", "source_account": "hz4mj-4592572071@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "cats": "NO", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "potrero hill", "source_state": "California", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=texas+street+at+%32%32nd+Street&amp;csz=San+Francisco+CA&amp;country=US", "source_loc": "sfbay", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+texas+street+at+%32%32nd+Street+San+Francisco+CA+US", "source_subcat": "roo", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "dogs": "NO", "source_heading": "Two Amazing Roommates looking for a third"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406618484, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410506484, "id": 1248758394, "price": 1500.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SFO-SNF", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-SFO", "locality": "USA-SFO-POT", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SFO-SAF", "zipcode": "USA-94107", "long": "-122.395122", "county": "USA-CA-SAF", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "37.758047", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01515_aGjNltH5Skc_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00808_hZrwdBpgtCr_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_fLClgoErPVr_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01111_cyOecQaw3jw_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_9T27cCbNbPC_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01515_7MYrXUrPZoB_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00101_b547Z7d7K1B_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_YFxRuiZqKd_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_2aEnwfhUk5O_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_4qPsDrqwU2y_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592572071", "heading": "Two Amazing Roommates looking for a third", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/roo/4592572071.html"}, {"body": "This room is renting for $1200 per month.
