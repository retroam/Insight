main road surrounded by towering pines on over 100 acres of natural beauty. This little one room cabin features a queen size bunk bed a comfy couch, 3 chairs, wood stove for heat, and a small kitchen area with gas stove for cooking. Sleeps up to 5 with couch. There is NO electric or water to this cabin, but there is solar lights and an outhouse. The lights work great, just like normal electric lights. Renters in the past have brought a generator and were very happy with their stay. It`s very private and secluded. Outside there is a nice relaxing hammock, a grill, table set and fire pit.

It would be $450 for one room, $525 for two rooms with a month to month lease which would include your heat & electricity and internet. Security deposit and first months rent due up front. Please have references ready. Sorry- no pets...my cat doesn`t play well with others :). Call, email, or text me today to set up a time to come by and view the house.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"source_account": "rxxgz-4592605237@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "phone": "2076321948", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_state": "Maine", "dogs": "NO", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=shore+rd&amp;csz=windham+me&amp;country=US", "source_loc": "maine", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+shore+rd+windham+me+US", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Professional Woman Seeks Roommate $450"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406627068, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410515068, "id": 1249244776, "price": 450.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-POL-WIN", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-POL", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-04062", "long": "-70.444265", "county": "USA-ME-CUM", "state": "USA-ME", "lat": "43.851505", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_2kIkNM9ujfD_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00303_6QKzObdjSU2_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_7fd7EqabKkF_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592605237", "heading": "Professional Woman Seeks Roommate $450", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://maine.craigslist.org/roo/4592605237.html"}, {"body": "Spacious 3br apt\n^^^^Nice kitchen\n^^^^Spacious living/dining room\n^^^^^^Heat & hot water included\nif you would like to schedule a viewing of the place please call or text\n show contact info\n For quick response please text and include link to ad\n each animal other by still help while write no of use city close line very which which each that been all night low large up page high high I move line house low last learn line you one say answer have men out find day house went between make old\n show think only sea help is been real change left father spell story does on water word draw we other have even word never say can very men been time can also my picture high don`t large been much be start than each come four mother large cover like this", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"available": "jul 29", "apartment": "YES", "dogs": "YES", "source_subloc": "brk", "bathrooms": "1ba", "source_account": "8rrjs-4592605243@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "phone": "3472011164", "bedrooms": "3br", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Prospect Heights / A,C 2,3,4,5, train", "source_state": "New York", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=Bergen+st+at+Franklin+ave&amp;csz=Brooklyn+ny&amp;country=US", "source_loc": "newyork", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+Bergen+st+at+Franklin+ave+Brooklyn+ny+US", "street_parking": "YES", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "cats": "YES", "source_subcat": "apa|abo", "source_heading": "&amp;#10048;&amp;#10048;SPACIOUS 3BR HEAT &amp; HOT WATER INLCUDED &amp;#10048;&amp;#10048;"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406627069, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410515069, "id": 1249271435, "price": 3000.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-NYM-BRL", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-NYM", "locality": "USA-NYM-FOT", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-NYM-BRO", "zipcode": "USA-11238", "long": "-73.955749", "county": "USA-NY-KIN", "state": "USA-NY", "lat": "40.676807", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00808_4QF4zI1dp0W_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_lVwb5V309BY_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_fZBR5Co1mg7_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01212_9lNkfg9285s_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00808_ffNoY5jm5Ov_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_FidNekwFBE_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592605243", "heading": "10048;10048;SPACIOUS 3BR HEAT  HOT WATER INLCUDED 10048;10048;", "category": "RHFR", "external_url": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/abo/4592605243.html"}, {"body": "The recent rain storm flooded our place so that my current tenant decided to move to a different place.

Must See Photos", "category": "RHFR", "external_url": "http://boston.craigslist.org/gbs/fee/4592606080.html"}, {"body": "So to start off this post I would like to point out once again that this is a SHARED ROOM, as in you will be sharing a room with ME. There are no walls in between our living area and you do not have your OWN room. This may sound unnecessary to point out but for whatever reason people like to overlook the reading aspect of reading posts and miss this point until they come over to check out a room.\nIf you are still reading this then you are still interested in sharing a room with me and I tried to make a post that I, myself, would have been interested in when I was searching for a place.\nI`ll start off with a little bit about me since you will be living with me and it is probably ideal that I sound appealing.\nI am a 22 year old student at Berkeley City College (you can still respond if you go to Cal I don`t discriminate) I work at In-n-out Burger in Oakland which is great for you because I am totally down with bringing you home a burger at the end of my shift whenever that is possible. I also have a car, and while I am not a taxi service I am also not against going places for whatever reason we/you may have.\nIn terms of my hobbies I like to go to the gym and lift some weights so if you are interested in that we can go together if our schedules permit, I also play some computer games (Dota2/LoL/Hearthstone are my games at the moment). I love watching shows when I can (Breaking Bad, Dexter, Parks and Rec, Community, Arrested Development, Archer, Game of Thrones, Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Mad Men are some that I have watched/watch). I love listening to music, my favorite genre is EDM, with trance being my favorite. I do go to Raves/concerts/clubs where DJs are playing when I am able to. However I do listen to other types of music (Muse, Arctic Monkeys, Weezer, Incubus, RHCP etc.) and will most likely be going to Coachella this next year. I do enjoy going out and having a great time but I do not come home wasted and ridiculous or anything so don`t be super put off by that. I am usually down to grab drinks/have some drinks and definitely to grab some food.\nIf this ad is still interesting to you I am sure we would get along pretty well anyway, I feel it is best to be up front from the get go so you get somebody you are actually compatible with, I am looking for a roommate who I can be chill with, not somebody who I dread seeing. With that being said we don`t have to be best friends either, there is a nice middle ground to be had.\nThings that may or may not bother you are that I come home late from work sometimes, obviously I will be considerate and as quiet as possible but I will probably shower before bed. Personally I am not a light sleeper so you can come in whenever you want, I grew up in a house with four brothers it would honestly be pretty hard to get seriously on my nerves. I definitely plan on having overnight guests at some point, whether it is friends crashing on a weekend or a friend who is visiting Cal the next morning. I am not saying this will be a regular occurrence but I am positive it will happen at least once and I will tell you ahead of time.\nI am a pretty clean and organized person and I would hope you were with our mutual space at the very least. All in all I am a very reasonable person and as long as you are we shouldn`t have any real issues, I do not do passive aggressive ridiculousness and hope you don`t either, if you have a problem tell me and we can talk it out.\nSo about the room, the room is the top (attic) of a three story (I think previous frat house) due to this the room is very large and positioned very well to work for two people to share. We have our own door that leads to stairs go up to our room so that is nice. The room has its own bathroom with a shower as well as a balcony with an amazing view. Currently the room is already furnished with a bed and desk for your section of the room. There is a very large kitchen at the first floor with three refrigerators and plenty of cabinet space as well as an oven/stove. There is an additional bathroom on the second floor that is open for anyone to use if they would like. We do have on site laundry in the basement and you can store things down there. There is a large lot behind the house for parking your car if you have one for 50$ extra a month, it is extremely convenient given the location and easily worth the money.\nThe house is located near the corner of Derby and Benvenue and is extremely convenient for anyone who does anything in the general area, whether it be work or school at BCC or Cal. We are located about a mile from either school and there is a bus stop for the 51B right around the corner as well as a food shop and cafe. The house is located basically equidistant to Rockridge/Downtown/Ashby Bart stations so you have your pick. It is also far enough away from everything that there is not a whole lot of traffic of students going through our street but still close enough to be convenient. Without bad traffic I usually get a 12 minute commute to work so this spot could work for you if you worked in Oakland as well.\nMy roommate will be moving back to France after his internship is over (August 25th) and you would just go under my current lease as a resident of the room.\nRent: 650$ per month\nUtilities: 30$ per month for half of the 50mb comcast internet that is already in place.\nDeposit: 750$ for half of security deposit, as well as an additional one month rent (650)\nThe Lease is until November of this year, and I will definitely be renewing it. I have lived here for almost one year and have no complaints.\nI am open to you only staying for X amount of months if that is your situation as long as you give me notice and still put down a deposit.\nAnimals are not okay based on the landlord\nI tried to cover every single last detail to avoid people who aren`t legitimately interested, but if you have ANY questions at all feel free to send them my way and I will be sure to answer them to the absolute best of my ability.\nFeel free to message me!", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406271790", "source_subloc": "eby", "source_account": "7tvns-4586324765@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "cats": "NO", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "berkeley", "source_state": "California", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=37.866400&amp;lon=-122.257000&zoom=16", "source_loc": "sfbay", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@37.866400,-122.257000,16z", "source_subcat": "roo", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "dogs": "NO", "source_heading": "Looking for Male for Amazing Furnished SHARED ROOM"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406627294, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410515294, "id": 1249269762, "price": 650.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SFO-BER", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-SFO", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SFO-EAS", "zipcode": "USA-94704", "long": "-122.257", "county": "USA-CA-ALM", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "37.8664", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_dE0bjgRe3Yp_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_gsuiIbwdM60_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_2yIHCgXPc7y_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_7zB17eHAO6X_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_f7cxqmBmVz1_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_7U4CdIUSHUr_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00808_6w8hyi7JFmp_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_3ekV8eQukB6_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4586324765", "heading": "Looking for Male for Amazing Furnished SHARED ROOM", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/4586324765.html"}, {"body": "Commonwealth Avenue\nThe Back Bay - Boston, MA 02116\nOffered at US$2,950\nProperty Type: Lease\nBedrooms: 1\nBaths: 1\nLiving Area 700 Sq. ft.\nProperty Highlights\n# The Vendome\n# Central a/c\n# 24 Hr Concierge\n# Bright & Sunny\n# Close To Public Transportation\n# Clean & Crisp\n# Elevator\n# Laundry In Building\nProperty Description\nThe Vendome.\nAvailable September 1.
