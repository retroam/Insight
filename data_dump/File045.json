Perfer woman roommate or couples. Move in available August 1st. We would like to offer our small room in our three bedroom Mobile for rent.

We would prefer know other pets but will consider one caged animal. Know ferrets. May also consider one small dog if fixed, house tranied, and healthy. No big dogs.We are a very easy couple to get along with as long as there is know drama We don`t like drama or riff raff. Also know illegal drugs of any kind 420 okay. Smoking cigarettes is okay but outside only. We like to keep our home clean so we want someone who is the same. The room is smaller can fit a full sized bed etc. Not a large room. The carpet has been freshly cleaned. It has a small closet also. There is a full sized bath that is shared once in awhile but mainly is for tenants so we would like for whom ever rents the room to keep it clean. We don`t ask for much just respect of our home and our rules. We also have washer/ Dryer as long as they don`t get miss used. We have replaced two washers and can`t keep replacing. U will have a key so u can come and go but know in and out all the time do to the respect of our neighbors. Rent for one person is $350 plus $100 nonrefundable deposit that includes utilities. If u are a couple looking to rent the room it will be $400 plus $100 nonrefundable deposit that includes utilities. We just ask that u don`t run up the Pud up so high and then the rent can stay the same. If u would like to rent our room let us know we will work out all the details. This is month to month renting. We don`t do credit checks or anything like that. All we ask is u not be on Doc etc. Must have proof of income. Tanf, SSI etc so we know u can pay rent each month. We don`t do we can move in now and pay u later. I`ve trusted to much and have people walk on me so I can`t do the trust thing anymore. Sorry about that. Must provide own food and essentials of your own. So if your looking for a drama free and safe place to call home email me. please tell me your name, and please let us know a little bit about yourself. Please text only. Hope to hear from u soon.

You would have 3 other roommates (all awesome girls in their mid-twenties), washer/dryer, backyard, garage for storage, and an incredible view of the Golden Gate Bridge from the kitchen window! You are 3 blocks away from Fisherman`s Wharf and Fort Mason and super close to all of the great bars/restaurants on Polk St. If you have a car there is plenty of street parking. I also currently have one of the parking spots in the garage which is available for an additional $150/month.\nThe small caveat is that my room is a converted living room with sliding doors that lead into the master so one roommate and her (adorable/quiet/hypoallergenic) dog will walk through occasionally. It has not been a privacy issue at all this year and definitely won`t be for such a small amount of time!

I`m interested in Vancouver or the northern side of Portland.\nI am very clean, friendly, respectful, trustworthy and hardworking. I am 22, and would like to move out with someone around the same age that has the same traits listed. I`ve been in search for a roommate the past few months and I would like to either find someone who would like to move out, so we can make the place our own. Or find someone who would like to have a wonderful roommate like me! I am willing to spend about $400 - $550 for rent. Preferably including utilities.\nI`m not a cat person, but I love dogs. I like to go out, meet new people, but I also like to stay home or go to the gym on my days off too. I work very hard as a server. Don`t worry about house parties, that`s not my style, but I do like to occasionally have my close friends over to play games.\nI do smoke, but only outside. If you smoke that`s fine, just outside please. Cooking is one of my favorite things to do so if you can dig it or help that`s wonderful! I am LGBT friendly, my two best friends are gay so I hope you`re comfortable with it. And I don`t do 420, I don`t care if you do but just not out of control making our house smell like Hemp Fest 24/7.\nLike I said earlier, I am very trustworthy, I am willing to share what I have as long as it is a two way street. I tend to keep to myself for the most part, I`m always busy so please don`t mind me always coming and going. I`m always down to hangout with a roomie though!\nIf you`re not into this whole reading about me thing and would like to meet me in person, if I am interested we can always go grab dinner or drinks to really get to know each other. I think that`s best personally. Let me know! Email me :)\nPS - I am really busy, and do not have the best wifi connection.

The apartment is in a 4-unit building on a quiet side street in Harvard Square, just minutes from the Red Line and the 66 and 86 bus routes, as well as 30 seconds from shopping and eating on Brattle St. Total rent is $5500 monthly, but will be divided up per person based on the size of the room that each person chooses. Broker fee is $5500, and will be divided up similarly. Utilities are not included, but are about $100 a month per person. The apartment is currently furnished as seen in the photos, but once the current occupants move out you will need to furnish your rooms yourself.\nA little bit about us:\nOne of us is a rising senior studying physics and philosophy. He grew up in Cambridge and is very familiar with the area. His interests included bicycling, jazz and classical piano, and Zen.\nThe other is a rising junior studying statistics, born and raised in Finland but in the US for the foreseeable future. His interests include guitar, minimalism, Finnish hip-hop, and foreign languages.\nBoth of us are serious students who also know how to have a good time. Ideal roommates would , like us, enjoy living a balanced lifestyle that combines peace and quiet with much-needed blowing off steam. We are not neat freaks, but like to keep a clean and uncluttered house.

I`m 25 years old, single, and work full time. Originally from LA, graduated from UofA in 2010 and about to finish my MBA from GCU. In high school you would have considered me the class clown. I love joking around, hanging out, and having fun. Love cooking, trying new things, and always down for an adventure or anything to pump my adrenaline. Easy to get along with. I`m somewhat intelligent and can hold a conversation quite well. I`m 420 friendly and love winding down with a delicious drink.\nChris is 23 years old, has a girlfriend (she`s cool), and also works full time. He is from a small town in northern California near San Francisco and graduated from MMI 2 years ago specializing in motorcycle mechanics. Spends a lot of time in the garage and is quite handy with his hands. Not much of a beer drinker but always down for a shot. He is outgoing, friendly, and also very easy to talk to.\nLastly is DJ. DJ just moved into the house about a month ago. He is 25, from Georgia, and recently graduated from Georgia Tech. He was a long distance runner in college and, believe me, he can run. He`s very social and easy to get along with.\nThe house:\nThe house includes a pool table, bar, 60\" flatscreen tv w/ soundbar, pool, misters, outdoor speakers, bbq, granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances, and a cool ass mutt named Moby. The term is month to month with a $250 refundable security deposit. Please give me a call or text with your name, age, and any questions you have and please let me know a little about yourself\n show contact info\n As I may get several responses please allow us at least 24 hours upon meeting you to make our final decisions.
