Two of our roommates have decided to move out a month early so now we need someone to move in to help pay for this month`s rent (due August 5th).\nThe room is about $1090 + utilities (which will usually bring it up to around $40-50)\nWe don`t mind taking two girls to share this room or someone who would like to rent it privately\nWe will be renting out this unit until the school year is over (late May/early June)\nI will be free to meet with you tomorrow and Thursday (if those days absolutely cannot work just let me know and we can try to figure something out).\nA TINY bit about is:\nWe are three female students attending SFSU (two senior, one junior).

I am a creative writing major while my other two roommates are majoring in cinema and business. I want to put it out there now and say that I have recently become a sort of neat freak almost to the point of Monica from Friends.

Huge floor plan and beautiful kitchen. You will have your own bed and bath. One of the bedrooms is an office. So I have 3 Open rooms but I am only looking to rent 1 room (maybe two if we feel it would be a good fit). High speed wireless internet, Direct TV, And pool access. Located on Harbor and Adams by the Costa Mesa Golf course. Please be ok with dogs as we have a friendly one. It has a huge LCD in the main entertainment room with a pool table and a more intimate living room with an LCD and fireplace. One of the rooms is a gym. The house is big enough where we won`t bump into each other. Looking for room mates around our age 24-34. I don`t smoke, but drink socially. I occasionally travel for work so I will need reliable and trustworthy room mates. Also I will be completing my MBA so between work, school and working out I will be pretty busy. Please be clean and drama free. I can rent the room furnished if you want. It just seems a waste to leave 3 bedrooms with private baths empty. Looking forward to hearing from you. I am living in LA right now and will be moving back to the house in November so it will be available then.\nEmail me with any questions", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406621721", "source_account": "9fkwh-4592586137@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "cats": "NO", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_state": "California", "source_neighborhood": "Costa Mesa", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=Harbor+at+Adams&amp;csz=Costa+Mesa+CA&amp;country=US", "source_loc": "orangecounty", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+Harbor+at+Adams+Costa+Mesa+CA+US", "source_subcat": "roo", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "dogs": "NO", "source_heading": "Private Bed &amp; Bath"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406623161, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410511161, "id": 1249245971, "price": 850.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-LAX-COS", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-LAX", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-92626", "long": "-117.919191", "county": "USA-CA-ORA", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "33.673319", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00606_bHtr6qtDrin_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_vA8PWq8jrP_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_jT4GyLmZ280_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01616_2pdWR2m6anH_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592586137", "heading": "Private Bed  Bath", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://orangecounty.craigslist.org/roo/4592586137.html"}, {"body": "This is a large master suite including a big bath room and spacious walk-in closet.

This place is awesome. It will be available this weekend on a month-to-month lease.\nThe place:\nAt the corner of Manhattan Ave., and 15th Street, it is walking distance to all of the cool sh1t Manhattan Beach has to offer. Its less than a block to the sand, 2 blocks to the Manhattan Beach blvd restaurants, bars, and shops, and a block to MB city hall, post office, and Live Oak park. The unit is in a 3-unit building right on the corner, so there are no neighbors to any side. It was recently renovated and upgraded on the exterior and interior, with granite counter tops in the kitchen and baths, double-paned windows, stylish shutters, and top of the line silky soft custom carpet in some rooms (hardwood in others, and porcelain tile in others). It also has a private balcony with stunning views of the pacific ocean, sunsets (pics), catalina, and down Manhattan blvd with a heated patio bistro table set and a barbecue. There are 2 tandem garage spots also, one of which would be yours. There is also a private laundry room downstairs that includes a coin washer and dryer that we only share with the downstairs neighbor. Also, a reality show celebrity lives downstairs and has occasional bbqs with the rest of the reality show C-stars, for anyone who cares. No big deal, hahaha.\nThe neighborhood:\nIn my opinion its the ideal spot in Manhattan Beach. Everything I love about MB is within a 2-block walk, and you can bike to everything else. Also, essentially no crime/vandalism whatsoever in MB generally, but the place is 2 blocks from the police station, so that makes it even safer. Its rare to find openings in this specific spot so close to everything -- believe me; it took me forever to find this place! And its even more rare to have the chance to get into one this inexpensively :)\nMe:\n30 yo straight ma1e, laid back, very clean and neat, quiet, dont smoke, and drink socially and have fun on the weekends. I work long hours, mostly in the office, and am primarily only home to eat, sleep and hang out on the weekends. On the weekends, I like to get outside and do different athletic stuff (volleyball, coed softball, golf, gym )... I can email you my facebook profile so you can get a feel for what Im about if you want..\nYou:\nnon-smoker, clean, and respectful of common areas. Facebook links are welcome if you have them. I will consider a girl if she is super laid-back/low drama (even though every one of you girls says you are haha) but the best fit would likely be a dude in twenties/thirties, but I of course dont discriminate.\nThe Room:\nBright (gets good natural light), hardwood floor, mirrored closet doors, and comes with its own private bathroom with and upgraded cabinets, lighting, and marble countertops (the nicer of the two bathrooms in the place). You get the room either partially furnished or unfurnished -- up to you. Its currently set up as an office/guest room with a desk, bookcase, and pullout sofa bed, but I can move those if you want.\nLease:\n-Month-to-month\n-you get the room + private bathroom + your own parking spot\n-$1600, plus a split of the utilities (except for water trash -- you dont have to worry about those)\n-Im probably not going to be uptight about credit checks or references, so dont sweat that either\n-the deposit will be a month rent due at move-in with the 1st month`s rent\n-comes with furnished kitchen, dining room, 2 bathrooms, and living room, with really clear/fast Verizon FIOS cable and wireless internet\nFeel free to email me if you have any questions", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406343514", "source_subloc": "wst", "source_account": "sxqgp-4587781657@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "cats": "NO", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Manhattan Ave. and 15th st.", "source_state": "California", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=Manhattan+Ave%2E+at+%31%35th+street&amp;csz=Manhattan+Beach+CA&amp;country=US", "source_loc": "losangeles", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+Manhattan+Ave%2E+at+%31%35th+street+Manhattan+Beach+CA+US", "source_subcat": "roo", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "dogs": "NO", "source_heading": "1 block to beach, private room,bath+pkng 2 blocks to MB blvd"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406623219, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410511219, "id": 1249249728, "price": 1600.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-LAX-MAN", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-LAX", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-LAX-WES", "zipcode": "USA-90266", "long": "-118.412962", "county": "USA-CA-LOS", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "33.886858", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_7Kv7ABfZow0_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_kv155FF2pdy_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_5SrHAZs4abI_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_lePH8EgwyPo_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01414_9hvpeomroUH_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_hsq9Vpx0dYl_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_i5AngyHk4GM_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_i77PjRgSuN3_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_AiliJz9hhA_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_jZPYWh04Bpu_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_4cReM0TIOQu_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_1DmMhncJqq_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00808_sZkZjbQ1t4_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01717_7OQFD4ymPxo_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_h2F0BU6Jtos_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_8pYVp77yNfz_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_amuBkjXDBac_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01414_65E4ttL4Kk2_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_239DqvOqA8z_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_fG3fSmAqs4C_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_9lPOKhSb6fy_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_5RXYax9xdwr_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01616_gv0SQ2jP7Kz_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4587781657", "heading": "1 block to beach, private room,bathpkng 2 blocks to MB blvd", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://losangeles.craigslist.org/wst/roo/4587781657.html"}, {"body": "We are three females who are working professionals.

Freeway close to all freeways 5/22/57/91/405/605 in a 4-Bedroom house. Currently occupied by owner me and 2 other professionals my cousin and her husband. Everyone does their own thing and minds their own business, so the house is actually rather quiet considering I am a Drummer that is . You must be Drummer friendly, and must be music friendly as that is my full time passion, part time profession and part time income. I am always gone performing on the weekends so I am gone a lot of the time. Rent is $650.00 (Monthly) which includes utilities - basic cable, electric, gardening and lawn maintenance on front of the property, gas, internet access AT&T , trash, and water - I pay for EVERYTHING I think the price is very FAIR. Sorry but you must share - Shared Bathroom shower, toilet and sink, shared kitchen access and shared laundry access washer and dryer must share with everyone. Nice, quiet neighborhood and there is a school at the end of the street Walter Elementary School so there is Laws and regulations for school zoning here and this area is serviced by the Orange County Sheriff as the property is located in County unincorporated territory and is not governed by city rules or city Taxes I love being in Unincorporated County it has its benefits. The house is clean, and orderly and I would like roommates to be the same and must respect and use the same rules of the household. This house is totally \"Drama Free\" and I respect this and will enforce the same rules to everybody ....we are all adults here. \"I just need somebody who is responsible with steady income !!!\". No smoking, drinking, drugs, or party animals, NO ALCOHOLICS I Do not Need Drama or Police. No exceptions !!! If you need serenity when you arrive home, this is the perfect place to live. The last Really Good roommate that lived with me here and stayed here at this residence was here for at least 13 Years he stayed until he finally saved enough to buy his own house and move out on his own - I met him from a good friend of mine who highly recommended him, so I did not personally know him at first and we have been the best of friends ever since.\nI rent out the master bedroom to my cousin and her husband . 1 bedroom is a spare room access to the Garage it is very small and I cannot rent it out, and truthfully I need to rent out the room ASAP my last day of work at my last employer was 04/01/2014. The room will be ready and available by 08/01/2014.\n Again absolutely No smoking allowed in house, no drugs, and no pets - We have absolutely No indoor pets of any kind in the residence No cats or dogs or any other indoor pets NO - Its cleaner and smells fresher believe me as I have never had pets indoors nor do I want to. I own 1 guard dog for my backyard that is good enough for this household , I don`t mind some alcohol use as long as it`s not too excessive. No smoking inside the house Cigars, Tobacco, Medicine or anything else.....only outside thank you .... Move-in is $650.00 and Security deposit is $500.00 upon Screening. Roommates must be mature professionals. Must have verifiable employment, good rental history, and good credit or do not waste your time calling I have no time for Drama.

The downstairs 1 BR is currently available.\nFeatures:\n- Gigantic bedroom\n- Large dining/living area\n- Bathroom\n- Closet\n- Sunny back doors that open right into the yard! There is a front door too.\n- You will have your own private bedroom, bathroom, living room and your own access to your apartment through the side door of the house, however the unit does not have a kitchen, so you will need to share the kitchen with the three of us upstairs. There are stairs inside the house that will lead you to our apartment upstairs and you can use the kitchen.\n- You will have your own fridge in the apartment (or keep it in the garage if you want), and previous tenants have just purchased a counter, microwave, electric range and toaster oven to cook small things, and just go upstairs if they want to cook full meals. We just can`t have a gas range downstairs.\n- Shared communal storage/shoe area/laundry downstairs\nAbout the other roommates:\n- There is one female and two males living upstairs in a 3 BR/3 BA. All in our mid-20`s. Two work in South San Francisco, and one works in the city. We are outgoing, social friends/coworkers/family that already know each other and will probably have dinners at home once a week, and like to go out to bars and restaurants as well. We are all Filipino or part Filipino, and like to keep the house pretty clean. I have a large lab mix who will be living upstairs and will frequent the yard.\nWho we are looking for:\n- 1 person to live in the downstairs apartment. Unfortunately we cannot accept more than one person at this point due to the lease terms.\n- Someone who will be OK with having to share the kitchen upstairs. Ideally we would have you use the downstairs fridge just so the upstairs fridge won`t be too full.\n- Dog lovers welcome! I have a dog and there will be other visiting dogs from time to time. My dog will also frequent the yard.\n- We are looking for someone who is also social and would enjoy having dinners or going out once in a while with us. We`re friendly people and would love to have a meal with you once in a while, since we are sharing the kitchen :)\nOpen house is this Wednesday at 5:30 - 6 PM.
