I live with my girlfriend but we aren`t really working out. I can be civil but she wants her space. I need a clean quiet place to rest my head at night. I`m clean, quiet and considerate and have no pets. I am allergic to some cats but not all (case to case). I work with special needs children and am excellent with kids. I don`t have to bring furniture, just clothes and maybe my laptop. I`d prefer a place for free but I can afford to help with $100 or so for the inconvenience. I am in a really hard place and need some personal space as well and I understand why my girlfriend (perhaps soon to be ex) needs to think before reacting after being together for 5 years. It feels almost more like a divorce than a break up. Any questions you may have I will be glad to answer. I do not smoke and only drink socially and that`s pretty rare.\nThanks,\nJustin\n show contact info", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "csd", "source_account": "7ntwh-4592495029@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_state": "California", "source_neighborhood": "San Diego", "phone": "6199290485", "source_loc": "sandiego", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "hsw|sbw", "source_heading": "Need a place to rest for a week or 2"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406608792, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410496792, "id": 1248545621, "price": 100.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SAN-SAD", "geolocation_status": 5, "metro": "USA-SAN", "locality": "USA-SAN-COE", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SAN-CIT", "zipcode": "USA-92101", "long": "-117.15726", "county": "USA-CA-SAD", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "32.71533", "formatted_address": "San Diego, CA, USA", "accuracy": 7}, "images": [], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592495029", "heading": "Need a place to rest for a week or 2", "category": "RSUB", "external_url": "http://sandiego.craigslist.org/csd/sbw/4592495029.html"}, {"body": "Office spaces available in prime Northlake business district, starting at $250 monthly.

Everything you pretty much need is there to use. Kitchen has pots and pans, utensils, dishes, glasses cups and many more items. Just bring your food or purchase at nearby grocery stores.\nIt is only a 2 story resort. This place has beds for six adults, maybe more, if you have small children. Keep in mind that this is a small family friendly cozy time share resort. Not the 5 star high rise timeshare resorts you may have visited before and that come with the high price tag as well.\nAnother hint is that we like to get a room just down the hall from the rec room or RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO A DENNY`S. If you look at the street view of the property on google maps, you will notice a driveway, which is ours to the left and behind it is an orange building next door that is on Harbor Blvd, same street at Disneyland. That Orange Building is Denny`s. We would go for breakfast with their $2,$4,$6, $8 menu and then head to Disneyland. Cheap Breakfast for the Disneyland area and it is practically on your doorstep.
