Each rental will include at no charge; use of the washer and dryer, 30mbs wireless internet, water utilities. The remaining utilities will be split among the five tenants and typically fall within $20-$40 per month.

The house has beautiful natural hardwood flooring throughout, with tile in the kitchen and bathrooms. The layout is great...with two living rooms, one connected to the kitchen and dining room. There`s a beautifully landscaped front yard and backyard with full privacy fencing around back. I recently bought a nice grill for the backyard, and there`s also a fire pit for once the temps get cooler. I`ve done a lot of gardening/planting, and you`re welcome to plant as well, but the main yard maintenance is my responsibility. The house even has a rain water tank, so there`s no guilt in keeping our yard and garden nice and green. There is laundry in the house, and also lots of room for storage in the double garage.\nI have already found one roommate, looking to fill the 3rd bedroom. (Totally open to you meeting her as well). The bathroom and linen closet pictured are for you to share with one roommate and the last house photo is the spare room available for rent. It`s about 11x10ft. The bathroom is between those two extra bedrooms, so no one shares a common wall.\nLooking to have roommate move-in sometime between now and mid September. Rent is $625 and that includes cable/internet (FREE HBO!!), gas, garbage, and water. Electricity split between all 3 housemates: about $30-$80/month total depending on the season, but split 3 ways.\nI have two very friendly cats and an adorable puppy. The cats are declawed (don`t be mad, they already were when I got them). I keep the litter box clean and let them be in the backyard most of the time.\nI`m a 32 year old female professional. I like to socialize with close friends by having and attending dinner parties, backyard bbq`s etc. I don`t typically go too crazy on the weekdays, but I`m more of a night owl than a morning bird. I try to stay active with running, biking, yoga, and hiking/camping trips. I would like to live in a household of people who get along well, could possibly be friends, but have their own independent lives and goals.\nYou`re a happy, intelligent human, willing to offer kindness and respect to those you live with. My wish list includes gardeners, cyclists, food enthusiasts, and good conversationalists. Please email me a little info about you, you`re interests, move-in date, pets, job, etc. Spammers, I can recognize you a mile away so don`t waste your time.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1405471196", "available": "jul 15", "dogs": "NO", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+%32%32%32%33+Waterloo+City+Lane+austin+Te+US", "source_account": "phfsv-4571067813@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "private_room": "YES", "sqft": "1500", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "North near Mueller", "w_d_in_unit": "YES", "source_state": "Texas", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=%32%32%32%33+Waterloo+City+Lane&amp;csz=austin+Te&amp;country=US", "source_loc": "austin", "cats": "NO", "attached_garage": "YES", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "private_bath": "YES", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Seeking 3rd roommate for 3/2 near mueller - hardwood floors"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406610459, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410498459, "id": 1248831433, "price": 625.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-AUT-AUS", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-AUT", "locality": "USA-AUT-UNH", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-78723", "long": "-97.673607", "county": "USA-TX-TRA", "state": "USA-TX", "lat": "30.312024", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_fmfCjLfuzMQ_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01616_4kH9cQWQoZ4_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00606_40Qxa7r1eHH_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_aAxj1bW3OX4_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_3dRNkpcToIl_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01414_c5DUT90QGe0_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_aYmz4W0YLWF_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_dl5srlQQOgr_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_axxMuFDArow_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_8WZ6S4uJPQh_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_2sG7LRz9w6r_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_g9WRIZeYHt8_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_fCTxmJulQUe_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_iC6lBiDeX6q_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_90QmGq5Z4i_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_eBOvWlaJXM3_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4571067813", "heading": "Seeking 3rd roommate for 3/2 near mueller - hardwood floors", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://austin.craigslist.org/roo/4571067813.html"}, {"body": "Malcolm x &amp;

I have a bedroom available by Sept 1st in a 2 bed/1 bath apt in a 5-unit building in Interbay/Magnolia. Your half of the rent would be $850 (inc w/s/g) + elec/cable/int, and it also includes an off-street parking space. The apartment is newly remodeled, with everything inside brand new, including a dishwasher and in-unit high efficiency washer and dryer. The empty bedroom is 12` x 11` with a nearly 6ft wide closet, and there is additional closet space available in the hallway. The whole apartment has lots of natural light, as well as a patio outside. The apartment is fully furnished except for your room, but if you have additional living room furniture, I`m sure we could find a place for it. We are one block from a 33 bus stop, and about a 3-5 min walk (with no hills!) to the D-line bus. Close to Ballard, and Queen Anne, it`s right off of a major bike trail, and walking distance to The Ballard Locks. The apartment also comes equipped with a 40\" TV, blu-ray, and wii, as well as a ton of board games and dvds. This is an especially great apartment for someone who sews or does crafts!\nI am looking for a fairly low-key female, preferably 20s-30s. No smokers, drugs, or heavy drinkers. I need someone responsible with rent, whether that means you`re employed or you have a trust fund, I really don`t care. I have no pets, but cats are allowed in the apt with an additional deposit. I am looking for someone who will commit to staying at least three months, but longer is better.

(#5) 432-sf of COVERED Storage Area.\nIn addition to the Buildings, the property INCLUDES:\n(#6) 10,375-sf of STORAGE YARD that is Fenced & Double Gated. (#7) 11,525-sf of PARKING Area in the front of the Office and Retail Buildings and Storage Yard.\nSpecific Features of #1-#7 above INCLUDE:\n (#1) 1,700-sf RETAIL Building has a Large open sales area and a small hallway to the Restroom and a small rear office. The Office has a wall mounted A/C unit and wall Heater. The RETAIL showroom has a Roof Mounted \"MasterCool\" Evaporative Cooler in the center of the room. The RETAIL showroom there are a pair of Double doors opening to the COVERED area between this RETAIL building, the SHOP building, the OFFICE building and the STORAGE Yard with the STORAGE Building located in the center of this yard.\n (#2) 1,150-sf SHOP Building is divided into (3)-three separate rooms with a common isle connecting them all together. At one end of the building there is a Large \"MasterCool\" Wall Mounted Evaporative Cooler that fans all (3)-three rooms, and the center room has a Wall Mounted A/C Unit. There is a large number of Electrical outlets located in this service area.\n (#3) 576-sf OFFICE has 3-seperate Offices and a Restroom. The entry door opens into the center office and directs you in either direction to the other (2) Two offices and/or the Restroom. The Executive Office (or Break Room) is located at the rear (West end) of the building and has a sink and cabinetry along with the controls for the A/C, Heat and Security Systems. This office also features a separate entry door the leads out to the COVERED area which connects to the RETAIL and SHOP Buildings, and into the STORAGE Yard. It has Central Heating / Air and a Security System and is permitted to be handicap compliant as of June 2013.\n (#4) 400-sf STORAGE Building is essentially a 20-ft X 20-ft Garage located in the center of the STORAGE Yard. It is located inline with the front Storage Yard entry gates. At one time in the past there was a full size Roll-up/Garage door in the front of this building. It had since been framed in and sealed. But, would be easy to re-install a Roll-up door as the Header and supporting framework are still present. The building has Double Man doors on its North side facing the SHOP Building and there is a recently poured concrete pad in front of the building and a New Roof was installed in May 2013.\n (#5) 432-sf of COVERED Storage Area. This is a Junction area between the RETAIL Building, the SHOP Building, the OFFICE Building and the STORAGE Yard. It is covered and has a concrete sidewalk to the above named area`s, which is very useful in the heat of Summer and during the Rainy season.\n (#6) 10,375-sf of STORAGE Yard. This Yard is completely Fenced with 6` slatted commercial chain link fencing on (3) three sides and a 4` commercial chain-link fence towards the street. There are a pair of double gates at the front of the Yard next to the OFFICE Building. It would be very easy to add another pair of Drive-through gates at the rear of the property in the private, dead-ended ally.\n (#7) 11,525-sf of PARKING Area in the front of the Office and Retail Buildings of which a small percentage has been updated with a county permit-ed concrete off-highway approach, water drainage collection pool, asphalt aggregate drive-way & parking area and legal concrete ADA parking space(s) and access ramp.

The property was last used as a Construction Company & Retail Plumbing Supply. Its located Just a few Blocks from the Colorado River and the California Border! The North wall of the property measures 8` X 86` and has direct Advertising Exposure to HWY 95.\nI prefer to lease the property as a whole, but would consider leasing individual buildings and/or the Yard Space where applicable. I will consider a LEASE / PURCHASE for the right person or company. I am reasonably flexible as far as terms and payment are concerned. Call me with your thoughts to see if we can come to a mutual solution.\nI live in Sacramento CA.\nCall me if you have further questions.\nREPLY BY EMAIL for a faster response OR call\n show contact info\nand leave message and I will call you back when I can.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"dogs": "NO", "source_account": "n7w3w-4592514000@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "phone": "9163383331", "cats": "NO", "sqft": "3825", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Mohave Valley", "source_state": "Arizona", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=34.864005&amp;lon=-114.598056&zoom=16", "source_loc": "mohave", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@34.864005,-114.598056,16z", "year": "2013", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_subcat": "off", "source_heading": "4-Buildings &amp; Yard on over a 1/2-Acre Parcel next to HWY 95"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406610513, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410498513, "id": 1248598369, "price": 1650.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-LAH-MOH", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-LAH", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-86440", "long": "-114.598056", "county": "USA-AZ-MOH", "state": "USA-AZ", "lat": "34.864005", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_dhHgvl7uI1m_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_jdk05Kg8VyP_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_fHl3D6i0UO9_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_jzVYrARrGlk_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_38XGeZuC0gh_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_ca7y1bZb2m1_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01616_c6zML85Pdqj_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00X0X_4h11SPjodFR_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_arKErcWcRGc_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_hNmQ0HpOtuM_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00000_iwgAr5A08As_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_44R7LT80NHD_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01717_kwX8ugnjIrD_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592514000", "heading": "4-Buildings  Yard on over a 1/2-Acre Parcel next to HWY 95", "category": "RCRE", "external_url": "http://mohave.craigslist.org/off/4592514000.html"}, {"body": "Industrial or warehouse space available in the Newport-Mesa area close to 55 hwy, 405 hwy, 73 hwy and PCH.\nUnit includes a 2,500 sq ft warehouse with loft storage, 2 bathrooms, shower, washer/dryer hook-up, 12`ft ceilings with skylights.
