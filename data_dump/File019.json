It`s the perfect location on the coast- just 20 minutes from San Francisco and super easy to commute from regardless of whether you work in SF or on the Peninsula. I will also be eventually filling the 3rd bedroom with 1 more person.\nYour large bedroom and private full bath will be furnished by you. It includes a large mirrored sliding door closet\nThe kitchen has your normal appliances (fridge, gas stove, dishwasher and microwave) and an eat-in kitchen. There`s lots of storage and a washer and dryer in the garage. The house has central air.\nThe living room is very large, fully carpeted with a fireplace and has immediate access to the large deck and backyard, perfect for gardening. I would welcome any furnishings, as my current roommate is leaving and taking most of the living room furnishings with her (though I will replace the major furniture, if needed).\nI am a 32-yr old professional female working as an office administrator. I`m laid back and mellow, and love spending time with friends but never loud, late night parties. Catching up on tv, reading, and hikes or the beach with my dog sum up my weekend.\nI plan on getting the house cleaned professionally once a month, due to my pup and just to relive the tension that I know comes up with sharing the deep cleaning responsibilities with others and I hope you will agree and split the cost.\nI love dogs and would be open to one other, well-behaved dog. I have one 3-year old dachshund/corgi/something mix. The house has a secure backyard with a deck and a doggie door to the garage so they can enjoy indoor/outdoor space. Unfortunately cats are not allowed on the lease.\nIf you`re interested please let me know a little about yourself and send a picture of your dog if you have one. The room will be available on September 1st and I am setting up some times to come view it on weekends this month.\nIf you love to surf and have a dog, this is the place for you!", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"available": "sep 01", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@37.594648,-122.495155,16z", "dogs": "YES", "source_subloc": "pen", "source_account": "k8srr-4592515293@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "private_room": "YES", "sqft": "1100", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "pacifica", "w_d_in_unit": "YES", "source_state": "California", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=37.594648&amp;lon=-122.495155&zoom=16", "source_loc": "sfbay", "cats": "NO", "street_parking": "YES", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "private_bath": "YES", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Master bedroom with full bath in dog friendly house"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406610631, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410498631, "id": 1248544174, "price": 1500.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SFO-PAC", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-SFO", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SFO-PEN", "zipcode": "USA-94044", "long": "-122.495155", "county": "USA-CA-SAM", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "37.594648", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_3GuwTH7iMSm_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_lj3DjaM6G3k_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_e7mp1r02INr_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_kANPeyzNteh_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_9wU1pV8dy0S_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_6BS79Q6qJaI_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592515293", "heading": "Master bedroom with full bath in dog friendly house", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/roo/4592515293.html"}, {"body": "This is a large 3 bedroom 3 bath oceanfront unit at Wyndham-Ocean Boulevard, Wyndham`s largest resort in the area.

We feel your pain.\nThat`s why we`ve come up with a way to make things as awesome as possible for everyone. In order to save money and get the most bang for our buck, we (a 20-somethings couple and our adorable dog) are hoping to find another bad-arse couple that wouldn`t mind teaming up with us to rent a 2 or 3 bedroom place in either Berkeley, SF, or Oakland. Anything close to public transport would work, since one of us is in grad school at Cal and the other works for a startup in the city.\nJust to give a bit more info, we`re both very easily amused and adaptable people who have a great time living with the company of others (and tend to act a lot more like friends around other people than an annoying couple, really!). We do a lot of hiking and backpacking, as well as cooking, enjoying wine/beer/etc, working on artwork/building projects, and endless playing with our dog that I promise you`ll adore (see picture). Living in an aesthetically pleasing place means a lot to both of us, so we`ve acquired quite a bit of cool mid-century furniture to bring with us. Ideally we`d move anytime starting in September at the earliest, and find a cool dog-friendly place that has some character, for a max rent of $1100 per person.\nThis is where you come in! If you are a couple and are feeling the same dilemma of price vs quality vs location, then look no further. Go home, think about it, and then tell all your couple-y friends, because no one should have to live in a crappy place alone when they could live in a great place together. Shoot us an email if you`d like to start to talk and see if we can`t combine forces to land a great pad in a great area.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"available": "sep 01", "dogs": "YES", "source_subloc": "eby", "source_account": "trrck-4592515343@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "sqft": "1000", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "berkeley", "source_state": "California", "private_room": "YES", "source_loc": "sfbay", "cats": "YES", "private_bath": "YES", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Looking for another couple to live with in SF/Berkeley/Oakland"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406610636, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410498636, "id": 1248755272, "price": 1100.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SFO-BER", "geolocation_status": 5, "metro": "USA-SFO", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SFO-EAS", "zipcode": "USA-94704", "long": "-122.27275", "county": "USA-CA-ALM", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "37.87159", "formatted_address": "Berkeley, CA, USA", "accuracy": 7}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01010_gT5TbjPaVip_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592515343", "heading": "Looking for another couple to live with in SF/Berkeley/Oakland", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/4592515343.html"}, {"body": "Unique, private and secure warehouse of ARTIST studios just off RICHMOND and ALLEGHENY Aves.

The house has beautiful natural hardwood flooring throughout, with tile in the kitchen and bathrooms. The layout is great...with two living rooms, one connected to the kitchen and dining room. There`s a beautifully landscaped front yard and backyard with full privacy fencing around back. I recently bought a nice grill for the backyard, and there`s also a fire pit for once the temps get cooler. I`ve done a lot of gardening/planting, and you`re welcome to plant as well, but the main yard maintenance is my responsibility. The house even has a rain water tank, so there`s no guilt in keeping our yard and garden nice and green. There is laundry in the house, and also lots of room for storage in the double garage.\nI have already found one roommate, looking to fill the 3rd bedroom. The bathroom and linen closet pictured are for you to share with one roommate and the last house photo is the spare room available for rent. It`s about 11x10ft. The bathroom is between those two extra bedrooms, so no one shares a common wall.\nLooking to have roommate move-in sometime between now and mid September. Rent is $625 and that includes cable/internet (FREE HBO!!), gas, garbage, and water. Electricity split between all 3 housemates: about $30-$80/month total depending on the season, but split 3 ways.\nI have two very friendly cats and an adorable puppy. The cats are declawed (don`t be mad, they already were when I got them). I keep the litter box clean and let them be in the backyard most of the time.\nI`m a 32 year old female professional. I like to socialize with close friends, by having and attending dinner parties, backyard bbq`s etc. I don`t typically go too crazy on the weekdays, but I`m more of a night owl than a morning bird. I try to stay active with running, biking, yoga, and hiking/camping trips. I would like to live in a household of people who get along well, could possibly be friends, but have their own independent lives and goals.\nYou`re a happy, intelligent human, willing to offer kindness and respect to those you live with. My wish list includes gardeners, cyclists, food enthusiasts, and good conversationalists. Please email me a little info about you, you`re interests, move-in date, pets, job, etc. Spammers, I can recognize you a mile away so don`t waste your time.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1405021538", "available": "sep 01", "dogs": "YES", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@30.311764,-97.672319,16z", "source_account": "d72mz-4562551701@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "private_room": "YES", "no_private_bath": "YES", "sqft": "1500", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "north central austin", "w_d_in_unit": "YES", "source_state": "Texas", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=30.311764&amp;lon=-97.672319&zoom=16", "source_loc": "austin", "cats": "YES", "attached_garage": "YES", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Seeking 3rd roommate for 3/2 near mueller - hardwood floors "}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406610639, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410498639, "id": 1248794467, "price": 625.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-AUT-AUS", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-AUT", "locality": "USA-AUT-UNH", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-78723", "long": "-97.672319", "county": "USA-TX-TRA", "state": "USA-TX", "lat": "30.311764", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01616_4kH9cQWQoZ4_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00606_40Qxa7r1eHH_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_aAxj1bW3OX4_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_3dRNkpcToIl_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01414_c5DUT90QGe0_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_aYmz4W0YLWF_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_dl5srlQQOgr_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_axxMuFDArow_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_8WZ6S4uJPQh_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_2sG7LRz9w6r_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_g9WRIZeYHt8_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_fCTxmJulQUe_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_fmfCjLfuzMQ_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_iC6lBiDeX6q_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_90QmGq5Z4i_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_eBOvWlaJXM3_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4562551701", "heading": "Seeking 3rd roommate for 3/2 near mueller - hardwood floors", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://austin.craigslist.org/roo/4562551701.html"}, {"body": "If you can use your women decor skillz and turn the bigggg frontroom into a room then its all yours.partitions??

About the room and house. Its the bottom floor of a big old school house in the Belmont/Hawthorne area. It has super high ceilings and big beautiful windows. Nice back patio area and a really big kitchen. The room is on the smaller side so it would be perfect for someone who doesn`t have a ton of furniture. Current roommate has a queen size bed, two smaller dressers and little table in there now. That kind of gives you an idea of the size. It has built in shelves and cabinets and a closet so there is plenty of storage. There are two big windows in the room so it gets plenty of light and ventilation. There are two male roommates living here currently and we are hoping to fill the room with another guy but the right cool girl could work. Both roommates are in their early 30`s. Are super nice and easy to get along with. Like to keep things on the cleaner side but are not neat freaks. Not looking for a party person to add to the house but we do like to drink beers and are 420 friendly. There is no deposit but you would need first and last months rent. So $800 for the initial move-in. If you`re looking to live in a great neighborhood with good people this is the place. Please email me here to set up a time to talk and see if it would be a good fit.\nCheers!", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "mlt", "source_account": "2kthw-4592515851@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "39th &amp; Belmont", "source_state": "Oregon", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=SE+Belmont+at+SE+%33%39th&amp;csz=Portland+OR&amp;country=US", "source_loc": "portland", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+SE+Belmont+at+SE+%33%39th+Portland+OR+US", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Room for rent in SE"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406610684, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410498684, "id": 1248543462, "price": 400.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-POR-POR", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-POR", "locality": "USA-POR-RIC", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-POR-MUL", "zipcode": "USA-97214", "long": "-122.622954", "county": "USA-OR-MUL", "state": "USA-OR", "lat": "45.516521", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592515851", "heading": "Room for rent in SE", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/roo/4592515851.html"}, {"body": "Do you need an office/cubicle or an entire floor?\nAmenities Included...\n\u2022 Fully-furnished space with designer office furniture\n\u2022 Personalized telephone answering services with call forwarding options\n\u2022 A receptionist to greet clients or visitors from 8:30am-5:00pm Monday-Friday\n\u2022 Upscale conference room and common areas\n\u2022 Kitchen areas with and use of refrigerator and microwaves\n\u2022 Mail handling and forwarding\n\u2022 High Speed Internet Access / Telecom\n\u2022 Digital business grade telephone equipment\n\u2022 Copying, Printing, Scanning, Faxing and Binding\n\u2022 Mail handling and forwarding\n\u2022 Maintenance, cleaning and utilities included\n\u2022 Free Parking\nPlease contact us for more information", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "fct", "source_account": "xbkgg-4592515854@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Stamford, CT", "source_state": "New York", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=41.088800&amp;lon=-73.543500&zoom=16", "source_loc": "newyork", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@41.088800,-73.543500,16z", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "off", "source_heading": "OFFICE SPACE STAMFORD - Bright and Comfortable"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406610684, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410498684, "id": 1248460234, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-NYM-STM", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-NYM", "locality": "USA-NYM-TUR", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-06905", "long": "-73.5435", "county": "USA-CT-FAI", "state": "USA-CT", "lat": "41.0888", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01313_7DrAtZovIjG_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_k4AL9rr5okU_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_5WqP6OGiOj_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_1fcUiayhMCq_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_q1UZcVSib1_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592515854", "heading": "OFFICE SPACE STAMFORD - Bright and Comfortable", "category": "RCRE", "external_url": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/fct/off/4592515854.html"}, {"body": "Beautiful One Bedroom apartment in Historic Harlem ----- -----------Feels like a great hotel room and is fully furnished with all towels and linens, pots and pans - new kitchen and bath are immaculate -microwave, toaster, coffee maker, garbage disposal, air conditioning, free cable tv, dvd, free wi-fi internet, free laundry.

Who are ok with not having our house be \"the\" party house, and having people in/out like grand central station. We love to hang, and love get-to-gethers, but in moderation.\n//The kitchen is huge! Tons of counter space and cabinets on both sides. Dishwasher, garbage disposal, 2 sinks, 2 fridges, a wine cooler/fridge built in, and a small utility closet. All new stainless steel appliances.\n//The living room is a good size with French doors that open up into the dinning room. Extremely open and very sunny.\n//Pets - cat is ok if friendly to other cats, if you keep the litter clean and swept off the floor. There is an extra $35 fee per month on top of rent if you have a cat. Litter boxes not welcome in common areas besides bathrooms.\n//A bit about us: Marie: I am the one working with the landlord to fill this house, and will be answering replies, and initial interviewing/showing. I am a professional gal in my 30`s, I work as the print production designer at a travel company. I do have a cat that lives with me. He mostly just sloth`s around my room, but does roam the house. I love music, travel, art and all things creative. I spend a lot of time during the week working and week day evenings for me are quiet due to my work schedule, I prefer keep my play time on the weekends and away from home 90% of the time, and we both prefer housemates that keep the majority of their play time away as well :)\n//Cedric: in my twenties, recently move out here from NYC, work for a biomedical company, I`m very neat, respectful, friendly and in all easygoing, I like traveling, music, sport arenas, road trips, movies etc, I tend to stay a lot in my room watching movies.the house so far is made of loving, neat and easygoing house mates.\nTell us a bit about yourself. Please don`t just ask if the room is still available. We want to know, how old you are. What you do for work, how long you`ve been there. What do you do for fun/down time, hobbies, interests etc. Please EMAIL inquiries here or TEXT. Please do not call if you want to hear from me promptly.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"bathrooms": "2.5ba", "source_account": "zzbhw-4592516344@hous.craigslist.org", "house": "YES", "source_neighborhood": "Somerville, MA", "w_d_in_unit": "YES", "original_posting_date": "1406610735", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+%32%35+Mount+Vernon+Somerville+MA+US", "dogs": "NO", "source_heading": "Huge renovated house, 5 min walk from T, Sullivan Sq", "available": "aug 01", "source_subloc": "gbs", "no_smoking": "YES", "bedrooms": "7br", "phone": "9782701439", "source_loc": "boston", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_continent": "USA", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=%32%35+Mount+Vernon&amp;csz=Somerville+MA&amp;country=US", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "source_subcat": "apa|nfb", "street_parking": "YES", "cats": "YES"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406610736, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410498736, "id": 1248550201, "price": 850.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-BOS-SOV", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-BOS", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-BOS-MET", "zipcode": "USA-02145", "long": "-71.079462", "county": "USA-MA-MID", "state": "USA-MA", "lat": "42.385373", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_5hkXZpgcS7g_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_2wFCeQhnUfH_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01010_6OXhHwjaJdT_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_3KnKwoDTZP2_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_iw6JCM64mNb_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_5lU7nH6h13C_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_1pKKqtJZdkR_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_f9iiTWe1n2C_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00101_hJjoaMDepQc_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01515_4cunLMTR1wV_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01616_cQL1MkHOoFj_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01414_596ZI4jYPG1_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_jg1Ll1jvRp_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01515_c8sWwtTsxOI_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_dIXJzoVRJgI_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_ga4TtwimLaF_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592516344", "heading": "Huge renovated house, 5 min walk from T, Sullivan Sq", "category": "RHFR", "external_url": "http://boston.craigslist.org/gbs/nfb/4592516344.html"}, {"body": "Note: Some of the pics in this ad were taken in panorama, so if they are distorted that is why. I wanted a wider depth of view.\nI live in a 2 bedroom, 2 full bath (each BR has its own bath) \"near new\" ranch-style condo in Canal Winchester. Canal Winchester is a safe, quiet suburb on the southeast side of Columbus near Pickerington and Reynoldsburg.\nThe condo is located off of Gender road, only minutes from Route 33 or Route 70 and is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. There are plenty of stores and restaurants surrounding this area.\nI have a nice unfurnished bedroom available. It is a large bedroom, has a large closet, and two windows. I have a two-car garage that has additional room for storage if needed. You will have your own garage door opener, with parking spots right by the front door. There are plenty of spots for guest parking next door to the condo as well. The condo is also an end unit, so there is no noise from neighbors.\nYour bathroom has a very nice shower with great water pressure, is quite large, and has a marble sink with a dark cherry wood framed mirror. There is room for a cabinet or something if you would like to add anything. I just put in two new LED shower heads in the shower that fade colors and make light shows. It`s pretty rad.\nThe kitchen has a new refrigerator and is fully stocked with cooking appliances, with plenty of cabinet and counter space. I like to cook, and I own a large Foreman Grill, Nutribullet, Keurig, rice cooker, crock pot, deep fryer, etc, in addition to the stove, oven, and microwave. I also have a dishwasher and garbage disposal. All of this is available for you to use so long as you take care of it and clean up after yourself.\nThere is also a second full size fridge/freezer in the garage for extra stuff.\nI also have a near-new washer and dryer hooked up in the laundry room. In the dining room is a pretty glass dinner table with a glass chessboard, flanked by a fish tank.\nI recently set up a gym in the house too, so I have weights and a machine for working out on site... Convenience :)\nThere are two paved patios in the backyard with surrounding grass (one on the side and the other in back), and they are completely fenced in for privacy and a great play area for my dog, Cleo.\nI am a 27 yr old, single, straight white male. I like sports, animals, music and generally being laid back. I am easy to get along with, (as long as you are not a total ass) and I keep my living space very clean. I work a desk job, but I try to keep my weekends free.\nI love reggae music, beaches, playing my drum, travelling, and dreadlocks. I spent years travelling the world teaching scuba diving, dj`ing, and running bars. I lived in Australia, Honduras, and all over the Caribbean, Bahamas, Virgin Islands, and various places in Canada and the US. I am well-cultured, articulate, and intelligent. I also practice meditation and other forms of self-enlightenment, and I am very into metaphysics and spirituality. If you are too, you will find a little piece of heaven here :) At the same time, I love to kick it, watch my buckeyes, cook a steak, and have a beer. I enjoy company, but my house is quiet and I respect others` space. Oftentimes you may find me reading, or playing chess. Travelling the world, I have lived with people from countless backgrounds, cultures, and ethnicities.\nI love animals. I have a beautiful Victorian/Olde English Bulldog and a couple of fish tanks spread throughout the house. If you are an animal lover, that is a big plus for me! If you don`t like dogs, don`t live here. LOL.\nI am seeking a down to earth, RESPONSIBLE, but fun roommate to share expenses with. Someone I can get along with, have a conversation or a meal with, or kick it with and has their life in order. I would like to talk or meet somewhere so we can see if we would fit as roommates, and if so, I would love to show you around the same day.\nRent is $500 a month, includes all utilities. A refundable security deposit of $350 minimum is required before moving in. This covers everything: rent, condo fees (lawn mowing, snow shoveling), and all utilities (high-speed internet with wi-fi, electricity, gas, water, and trash). This is a discounted price. Market rent here is $900+. The security deposit is required before moving in, just as in any place.\n I do not have a standard \"lease\", so to speak, but there is paperwork that must be signed before moving in for liability reasons. I rent month to month. This is meant to make the room renter friendly, ensuring that no one is contractually obligated to stay if they find a better living situation for them. However, I do require a 30 day notice before moving out so I can find a new tenant.\nYou can reach me by sending a text message or calling\n show contact info\n or emailing me if you want more information. I am looking for someone fun, relaxed, and responsible. 420 friendly would be a plus too. :)\nCheers, and thanks for reading\n~Ryan\np.s. : this ad gets a lot of spam responses, so put \"condo ad\" as the subject of your email, or it may not get read.

The room is small so we are only charging $550 for it. This is a steal! Come be our friend! I have outlined the pertinent details below.\nLocation: We are on the corner of McGrath and Washington, at the end of Union Square and 1-2mi from Lechmere, Inman, Central, Harvard, Porter, Davis, and Sullivan squares. There`s a very active bus stop across the street so trans is super easy.\nThe Apartment: Toilet. Roof. We just got a TV! We actually have all the furnishings for a fully functional home. We look like adults!\nWho we are: We are actually adults! We are both professional females on the downward end of our twenties. We enjoy wine, reading, cooking, cleaning, beer-B-Qing, browsing reddit while watching TV, arts & crafts, bike rides, concerts, karaoke, board games made for children, and heated debates. Roommate 1 works as a scientist in Cambridge and Roommate 2 works in wine in Brighton.\nWho you are: We are looking for someone with an income who is tidy and respectful. You might enjoy having a drink or seeing a concert with us. You don`t have passive aggressive tendencies or an AOL.com/hotmail email address.\nThe catch: No dishwasher. No garbage disposal. The bathroom is really tiny. Laundromat is a drive away; I have a car that primarily gets used for laundry and Market Basket trips. No pets allowed. There is a bunch of construction going on on the overpass so no parking in front of the house for now.\nThe perks: Did I mention Roommate 2 works in wine? This is beneficial. The place is entirely furnished, a basement for storage, and since you have the choice of two small rooms, you can use the other`s closet for clothing or other personal storage if you`d like. As a whole, it`s a good sized place for three people. There`s a pretty sweet back patio that has a beautiful view of the Boston skyline when the vines aren`t too overgrown. Union Square has tons of bars and restaurants, a farmer`s market, and the Fluff Festival. The location of the first official raising of the American flag is a two minute walk away.\nThe lease is Sep-Aug. It`s currently vacant so we`re flexible.
