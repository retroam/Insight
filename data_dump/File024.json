I used to charge 700 for the room monthly, but now charge 650 because of the paint. Reasonable utilities are included. Current residents include two professional women who are funny, kind, and good communicators; along with 2 dogs and 1, 5 pound, snarky alien with fur. (The other lady here tells me it`s a dog, but I don`t think The Alien agrees.)\nThe available room shares a bathroom with the other lady who keeps it very clean. There is a second bathroom attached to my bedroom. Each person has access to all the public areas of the house, (including the living room, kitchen, garage, and yard). There is WIFI, cable, A/C, fireplace, washer and dryer. The yard is large and fenced. The dogs spend their days playing in the yard and sleep in the house at night. The Alien is an inside creature that stays in my roommate`s room polishing her nails, rearranging the furniture, and organizing the closet.\nMy home is located 1 mile north of CSUF around the corner from a major bus route, and there is parking available. The neighborhood is very safe, calm and pleasant. We are within walking distance of a couple of parks.\nIf you think you would fit in, please let me know and we can `chat`.

I am looking for a mature woman but I might consider a mature male as long as he is kind and respectful of me.\nThe bedroom that is available is about 9 x 12 and has a large closet which runs the width of the room with shelving on top and on the left side of the closet for more storage. The furniture shown in the picture is not included. You will have to provide your own bed and furniture.\nRent is $800/month PLUS utilities. Utilities are $100/month and that includes Cable, Internet, WIFI and Electricity. So the total amount due on the 1st of every month is $900.\nA Security Deposit of $750 is required prior to move in.\nThere is a Cable for TV available for your bedroom. You may watch a movie or a TV show in the living room in moderation. All I ask is that you refrain from watching violence. I prefer to keep a peaceful, positive environment.\nThis is a month-to-month arrangement. I am planning on moving by the end of the year so if you decide you want to stay after December then you are welcome to apply to the management company to draw up a new lease in your name and live here by yourself or find a suitable roommate.\nYou have use of the main (shared) bathroom that has a full tub and shower with storage underneath the sink and also 2 drawers for your toiletries. This is a shared bathroom so it must be kept clean.\nThe room that is available is for one person only. I prefer to have a roommate who is mature and has a full-time job working outside of the home. I work from home so it just works best for my roommate to be working outside the home. In my spare time I like photography, astronomy and energy healing (I am a Reiki Master-Teacher). I also do meditation and am starting to do some Yoga so I encourage you to apply if you are interested in the same things.\nYou will need to fill out an application and provide a $25 credit check fee for the management of the building along with a copy of your driver`s license or state ID. They will need to approve your application before you can move in. This is standard procedure for all tenants living in this building.\nLet me know if you would like to schedule a time to come look at the room. I can show you the room, bathroom and the common areas, the pool, and the laundry room. Then we both can decide if we would like to be roommates.\nThank you for your interest and I wish you luck in your search.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"source_account": "kd8qd-4586635597@hous.craigslist.org", "source_neighborhood": "Brentwood", "laundry_on_site": "YES", "off_street_parking": "YES", "original_posting_date": "1406300312", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+San+Vicente+at+Barrington+Los+Angeles+CA+US", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Apartment to share", "available": "aug 01", "source_subloc": "wst", "no_smoking": "YES", "bedrooms": "0br", "private_room": "YES", "source_loc": "losangeles", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_continent": "USA", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=San+Vicente+at+Barrington&amp;csz=Los+Angeles+CA&amp;country=US", "no_private_bath": "YES", "sqft": "108", "source_state": "California", "dogs": "NO", "cats": "NO"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406612288, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410500288, "id": 1248542609, "price": 800.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-LAX-LSN", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-LAX", "locality": "USA-LAX-SAW", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-LAX-CEN", "zipcode": "USA-90049", "long": "-118.465513", "county": "USA-CA-LOS", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "34.053709", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_bKI6GChlXqy_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_hWXLtXfIWL3_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_eIEYFAk75Sm_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_2yzfDHwMBUx_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4586635597", "heading": "Apartment to share", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://losangeles.craigslist.org/wst/roo/4586635597.html"}, {"body": "August 13- Sept 30.

Rooms can be rented together or separately. Both rooms are on the second floor. There is a full bathroom located between the rooms. One room is $450 or both for $1000. The deposit is $600 for a single room or $1000 for both. Electric, garbage, tv, internet, and water are all covered in rent. I am also living here. There is a $35 background fee for each person over 18 in age to apply in order to be accepted.\nThe rooms themselves are large and can easily fit a king sized bed just fine with plenty of space. The kitchen and living space will be shared. I can send pics to serious renters. Maintaining a job is a must. Drug free, No smoking (including Marijuana for any purpose) outside pets are allowed , dogs or cats. . I have 4 cats that are friendly and two lab`s that are also friendly with both people and other animals. Dogs will need to meet to see if compatible.
