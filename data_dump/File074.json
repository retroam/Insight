Let me be honest - its tough to find `good` roommates and it`s a hassle to keep looking for roommates at that frequency.\nI would ideally like someone who wants a place to call `home` and intends to live here for the forseeable future (I understand that circumstances can come up where someone HAS to move). If this is you, please read on for details:\n 1. Rent includes all utilities ( including internet). Parking is extra ($40 for outdoor and $60 for indoor).\n 2. Washroom is shared (with another female)\n 3. Location: Major intersection - West Mall and Bloor\n Nearest subway station: Kipling (5 minute bus ride)\n TTC bus stop at doorstep\n 4. The room is unfurnished - there is a spare twin mattress that can be used.\n 5. Your roommates are a couple - me and my husband (Its important that you see us as 2 separate roommates and not as a couple. We are not territorial and all common areas are meant to be used by everyone)\n 6. The other roommate is also female (the one you would be sharing a washroom with). She has a 3 year old dog who is very well trained. All of us are in the late 20-s to mid 30-s age group.\n 7.

Includes utilities...Shared House 2 Marilyn Ln, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 $570/mo KEY FEATURES Sq Footage: 2200 sqft. Bedrooms: 6 Beds Bathrooms: 3 Baths Parking: 4+ Off street Lease Duration: 1 Year Deposit: $500 Pets Policy: No Pets Allowed Laundry: In Unit Property Type: Single Family House DESCRIPTION I am offering individual bedrooms to studious UNC students in an elegant, large, 6 bedroom house with oak floors, located off of East Franklin Street. It is less than one mile from campus. The house is partially furnished. It is available for occupancy August 1st, 2014. Off street parking is available for six cars. In addition the house comes with a large LCD HDTV in the living room. The house has a washer and dryer, whole house central AC and high speed internet available if desired. The house is free-standing and in a quiet wooded neighborhood. It has a large kitchen, a large living room with a working fire place, and a large dining room. The large kitchen has a dishwasher, garbage disposal, and two large refrigerators. There are 3 bedrooms on the first floor and 3 bedrooms on the second floor. There are two bedrooms on the first floor that share a bathroom, and all three bedrooms on the second floor share a bathroom, both with a tub and shower. The security deposit is $500 per room. No smokers please. No pets. My goal is for 5 to 6 UNC students to occupy rooms for the year. I prefer UNC students only because I want to maximize the chances that the residents will get along well. The rooms will rent for $570 per each including all utilities. My preference is to rent to people who will stay the full year, but it is possible to rent for a shorter period if you will find your own replacement for the remainder of the year.

Relatively quiet household.\nAvailable August 1.\nReply by email with some info about yourself and your lifestyle.\nThanks.\nWe look forward to hearing from you!\nPS There`s a fantastic cat who lives here so if you`re allergic or have a pet, It won`t work.\nAnother consideration -- this is a non-smoking and fairly scent-free, that is very low perfume or chemical tolerance house. If you smoke at all, including outdoors on the porch, it won`t be a good match. Thanks.
