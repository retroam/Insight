Ten minute walk to Lloyd center/MAX. Under ten minutes to Fred Meyer. Few blocks south of the restaurants/shops/bars of Broadway. Buses: #70, #8, #77 a few blocks away, #19, #20, #12 not too far. Great for non drivers like me, but conveniently off the Banfield for drivers.\nTHE SPACE:\nAvailable is the quite big larger room in a two bed, one bath apartment. On the second floor, accessed by covered stairs, there`s a nice view of the neighborhood foliage. You also get two closets and half the basement storage. BRING YOUR FURNISHINGS! I just have a few, generally mismatched things for living, dining rooms, and kitchen.\nApartment complex built in 1960s but kept in repair. Coin Washer and dryer on premises (in basement with external access).\nCats ok per landlord ($200 deposit) but not really looking to take on pets.\nCar port available!\nME: gay male, Mid-thirties, stably employed (ten years at same company), Semi-sporty (gym, hiking, sometimes soccer), with mostly old-timey tastes (classic movies/music , opera, art museum). Prefers books to video games, fondness for travel and eating out, good cheap food. Drinks in moderation, omnivorous, with no allergies.\nLOOKING FOR:\nStable, low-drama, trustworthy, relaxed but responsible roommate. Friendly and pleasant enough to chat a bit, communicative enough to get the needs of the apartment done, but respectful of personal things and private time. Stable/verifiable employment, pays bills on time, pitches in to help keep place clean. Smoke/drug/420 free.\nI MUST STRESS: the pleasant, peaceful nature of the neighborhood. Other tenants are young but not partiers. No one`s loud, sound may carry between apartments but interior is well insulated. HOWEVER, being off the I-26, the freeway creates white noise. Windows are double glazed and trees provide some sound block in summer.\nI treat the apartment as personal space for downtime and relaxation, not really a social space. I myself rarely entertain, a few people would be ok, but not a crowd.\nTHE OFFER:\nMonthly: $520 rent + split utilities (approx $40 wifi + approx $25 electric)\nLease is month to month with 30 day notice to move, but if we`re a good fit, looking for someone to stay a while (I`ve already been here 2 \u00bd years, and some neighbors up to a decade). Rent rarely increases.\nUP FRONT COSTS:\nCredit/criminal background check: $30\nSecurity: $200\nFirst month`s rent\nApplication with proof of income (payroll doc, bank statements)\nIf you`ve read this far, you must be interested, so reply and tell me about yourself!", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "mlt", "source_account": "k8hjq-4592580333@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "phone": "5037573181", "cats": "NO", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Lloyd / Sullivan's Gulch", "source_state": "Oregon", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=NE+Multnomah+at+%32%34th+&amp;csz=Portland++OR&amp;country=US", "source_loc": "portland", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+NE+Multnomah+at+%32%34th++Portland++OR+US", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Roommate to share two bedroom, close in, peaceful Sullivan`s Gulch "}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406620273, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410508273, "id": 1248784476, "price": 520.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-POR-POR", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-POR", "locality": "USA-POR-IRV", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-POR-MUL", "zipcode": "USA-97232", "long": "-122.641223", "county": "USA-OR-MUL", "state": "USA-OR", "lat": "45.531446", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00505_8roCVo9cWAW_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00202_jqAF7vDD7VX_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00101_16YTLM9tMXr_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592580333", "heading": "Roommate to share two bedroom, close in, peaceful Sullivans Gulch", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/roo/4592580333.html"}, {"body": "We are currently seeking 1 each of the following:\nEsthetician, Lash Extensionist and Threader.\n Located in central Temecula, flexible hours.\n1 Private Full Time Room available and 1 Part Time Room.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"dogs": "NO", "source_account": "jktg2-4592580412@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "sqft": "200", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_state": "California", "source_neighborhood": "TEMECULA", "phone": "9513313309", "source_loc": "inlandempire", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "off", "source_heading": "FULL &amp; PART TIME ROOM FOR ESTHETICIAN, LASH EXTENSIONIST OR THREADER"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406620289, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410508289, "id": 1248799439, "price": 450.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-LAX-TEE", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-LAX", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-92590", "long": "-117.14836", "county": "USA-CA-RIE", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "33.49364", "formatted_address": "Temecula, CA, USA", "accuracy": 7}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_axVkYdPezVS_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00101_cNGOB5UdSGz_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_kXsBqRTArWA_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592580412", "heading": "FULL  PART TIME ROOM FOR ESTHETICIAN, LASH EXTENSIONIST OR THREADER", "category": "RCRE", "external_url": "http://inlandempire.craigslist.org/off/4592580412.html"}, {"body": "We offer two 1 bedroom/1 bath furnished casitas located in a quiet, historic neighborhood.

It`s a private, cozy, charming, garden setting in the thick of our urban hustle and bustle! A perfect mix of quiet and serenity at home--a great setting for creative types--and lively, interesting places to eat, play and shop nearby.\nWe`re creative types ourselves, working (sometimes in the front, main house, and occasionally out of town) in TV, film, eco-friendly apparel, and home renovation, and have hosted TV and screenwriters, filmmakers, composers, actors, music producers, opera singers, chefs, urban farming planners, costume designers, internet gurus, a language translator, physicians, lawyers, professors, journalists and photographers.\nWe`d love to know a bit about you, and what brings you to the area, and would be happy to tell you more about us, answer any questions you have about the property or the area, and can provide a list of references, too.

(We will probably furnish as a writer`s nook, with a small table and chair that can easily be removed)\n\u2022 Hardwood and tile floors, and great moldings throughout\n\u2022 Tiled kitchen (8`x10`) with refrigerator, vintage stove, microwave and douglas fir wood floors\n\u2022 Tiled bathroom (5`x9`) with original deep tub beneath private window with woodsy view\n\u2022 Your own washer and dryer\n\u2022 A/C window unit and gas wall heater\n\u2022 Feels very light and airy, and very private even though the yard in front is shared with front main house\n\u2022 Utilities included (Including power, water, gas, wifi, trash, gardener). Depending on length of stay, premium cable may be available. No landline phone is provided.\n\u2022 Fully furnished, including equipped kitchen, housewares and linens -- Just bring your suitcase and groceries!\n\u2022 Continental breakfast available upon request. Ask us more about this!\n\u2022 Will consider pets with additional pet deposit -- see below. Yard may have the occasional well-behaved cat or dog visiting with their owners as guests in our front main house.\n\u2022 We prefer non-smokers. All smoking is permitted outside only.\nTHE PROPERTY:\n\u2022 Secure, key-entry gated property / Up about 40 steps\n\u2022 Ample non-restrictive street parking on quiet street, usually within 4-5 driveways of our driveway. There are no parking time limitations (other than the city-wide 72 hr limit) nor \"street cleaning\" days, and no residential parking permits are required.\n\u2022 Front house is rented out on a similar basis, and/or owner-occupied (+ 1-2 quiet roommates, typically 30/40-somethings. We are early 40s creative professionals + happy baby! ...some/all of whom are sometimes out of town with family or for work)\n\u2022 Large shared yard (50`x50`) in between your cottage and our main front house (where we live and sometimes rent out up to two of our four bedrooms--see our other listing on Airbnb). Yard has a lawn, rose garden with pebble path, fruit trees (lemon, white sapote, kumquat and fig), brick patio, firepit (we sometimes have a stash of firewood!), weber gas bbq, hammock, tree house and vegetable and herb garden (vegetable garden and grapevines are a bit dormant this time of year, though!). Depending on the season and weather, our homemade ping pong table, boules, croquet or badminton sets might be set up on the lawn and are ready for your use! The entire back yard and all of your cottage and private back yard are fenced in, on our 8,000 sq ft lot. Also consider yourself forewarned of the occasional skunk, raccoon or opossum (we even had two coyote sightings) come dusk!\nLOCATION:\n\u2022 The cottage is nestled, hilltop, behind our front main house, up about 40 stairs. We`re in a wonderful, quiet, hilly neighborhood, north of Sunset Blvd. on the border of Echo Park and Silver Lake.\n\u2022 It`s just a few blocks to Echo Park, Edendale Library, Urth Yoga, quirky indie boutique shops and restaurants, etc. in Echo Park: Downbeat Caf\u00e9, Brite Spot, Pho Cafe, Mohawk Bend, Miyako Sushi, Masa, as well as Vons, Rite Aid, gas stations and fast food, too. Silver Lake Reservoir and walking path, and the adjoining newly opened Meadows park (great for afternoon kite flying!) area are also a brisk walk away.\n\u2022 Also nearby: Silverlake`s Sunset Junction, Trader Joe`s, Vista Theater, Los Feliz Village, Atwater Village, Downtown LA (each of these areas with its own Farmers Markets), Dodger Stadium (we`ve walked the 1-1.5 miles there for a game), Chinatown and the 101, 110, 5 and 2 freeways. Silver Lake is central to Hollywood/Burbank/Glendale studios. Various buses stop at the nearby Sunset Bl. and Coronado St. intersection. Our \"walk score\" is 85, \"Very Walkable\"!...but don`t forget to account for the fairly steep hills you have to climb and descend if you`ll shop for heavy groceries on foot!\nFEES:\n\u2022 Application fee -- longer stays (or any bookings not done through the other site) require a rental application and credit report for $15 per person.\n\u2022 Cleaning fee -- We include a $75 cleaning fee which will be reflected in your final reservation amount. This is for standard cleaning and any additional cleaning (such as for a sink full of dirty dishes!), will be extra.\n\u2022 Number of guests -- With the blow up aerobed mattress we offer, the cottage can accommodate up to four people, for an additional $10/night per additional person after the first guest. As the cottage is definitely on the cozy side, we do not recommend longer stays for more than two people, though! (or two adults plus smaller children...we may be able to offer a travel crib) Any impromptu additional overnight guests` rental rate will be taken out of deposit, as well.\n\u2022 Pets - Small, well-behaved pets will be considered. Please tell us about your pet before booking. See pet deposit, below.\n\u2022 Deposits -- For shorter term stays, we charge a $600 refundable deposit, and may be able to go through the other site to have them hold your deposit. For longer term stays, we charge a higher deposit (usually about one month`s rent for monthly rentals) depending on length of stay, and your references, etc. Pet deposit is $200 and up, depending on your type of pet.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"available": "sep 01", "dogs": "YES", "source_subloc": "lac", "bathrooms": "1ba", "source_account": "pdxr7-4592581583@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "furnished": "YES", "bedrooms": "1br", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Silver Lake / Echo Park", "w_d_in_unit": "YES", "source_state": "California", "cottage_cabin": "YES", "phone": "7215760366", "source_loc": "losangeles", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+Coronado+at+Reservoir+Los+Angeles+CA+US", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=Coronado+at+Reservoir&amp;csz=Los+Angeles+CA&amp;country=US", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "cats": "YES", "source_subcat": "sub", "source_heading": "per week - Hilltop 1920s Craftsman 1+1 Garden Cottage--FULLY FURNISHED"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406620577, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410508577, "id": 1249270703, "price": 1200.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-LAX-LSN", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-LAX", "locality": "USA-LAX-SIV", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-LAX-CEN", "zipcode": "USA-90026", "long": "-118.267071", "county": "USA-CA-LOS", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "34.079962", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01212_bkiLnWMncXp_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00808_7SQnTX3Lt8k_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_7w2Ye8v9GbK_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00909_coQeUQRpqBf_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_1STyuINnZEC_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_5MGQrb0wsPO_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_j5zO37iluk9_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_bg9C3vvDluo_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00707_29XZcY8DGlc_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_hCHZLr6d3Hq_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_4KwUmIk5t2n_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_cDfBsVziHbc_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_dGK6vnpFU96_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_lr0Fkjo09HN_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00606_iqfiNIJ5JG5_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01111_lr3VeT65c41_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01313_nCpsoiOKPl_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_273ztP5qsVz_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_h0fbOUFi7tc_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592581583", "heading": "per week - Hilltop 1920s Craftsman 11 Garden Cottage--FULLY FURNISHED", "category": "RSUB", "external_url": "http://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/sub/4592581583.html"}, {"body": "Room for rent in a nice 2 bd 1.5 bath townhouse in downtown Eagle River.

The unit will be available for move-in anytime during the months of September or October, and you`ll be able to lock in the low price all the way through the end of June, 2015. At the end of the lease, you can renew with the property management company and keep the apartment even longer (subject to their renewal rates, etc.), or you can move.\nFor only $1290 per month (way cheaper than any of the other remodeled two-bedroom apartments in Bloomingdale), you`ll get a prime unit with stainless steel appliances, courtyard views, vaulted ceilings, a wood-burning fireplace, washer/dryer in unit *and* the $1290 price includes a one-car private garage space! To make this offer even more attractive, I`m transferring my deposit over to you. This means you`ll only need to pay a small application fee directly to the leasing office (~$60), and that`s it! The only other money you`ll need to move in is your first month rent, once you sign a lease.\nYou will enjoy the convenience of Stratford Places` location. An abundance of shopping and dining options can be found just moments away. With quick access to both the expressways and the train, you can get downtown, to the airports, or anywhere else you need to go quickly and easily.\nApartment Features: Pets allowed (no weight limit for dogs/certain breed restrictions & pet rent applies) \u2022 Central Air Conditioning \u2022 Forced Air Gas Heat \u2022 Private Water Heater \u2022 Woodburning Fireplace \u2022 Washer/Dryer Included \u2022 Vaulted Ceilings \u2022 Carpet and Vinyl Wood Flooring \u2022 Faux Wood Blinds \u2022 Modern Track Lighting \u2022 Ceiling Fan \u2022 Custom Paint \u2022 Private Balcony \u2022 Cherry Cabinetry \u2022 Dishwasher \u2022 Refrigerators with Ice Maker \u2022 Garbage Disposal \u2022 Stainless Steel Appliances \u2022 Brushed Nickel Fixtures and Hardware \u2022 Large Walk-In Closet(s) \u2022 Hollywood Lighting in Bathroom \u2022 Curved Shower Rod \u2022 Garages", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"bathrooms": "1ba", "source_account": "f6krn-4587521321@hous.craigslist.org", "source_neighborhood": "Bloomingdale", "w_d_in_unit": "YES", "year": "2015", "original_posting_date": "1406329928", "apartment": "YES", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+butterfield+drive+at+springfield+dr+Bloomingdale+IL+US", "detached_garage": "YES", "source_subcat": "sub", "source_heading": "^^^//2BR/1Bath @ Stratford Place - Price includes garage space!\\\\^^^", "available": "aug 25", "source_subloc": "wcl", "bedrooms": "2br", "phone": "3127259365", "source_loc": "chicago", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_continent": "USA", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=butterfield+drive+at+springfield+dr&amp;csz=Bloomingdale+IL&amp;country=US", "sqft": "926", "source_state": "Illinois", "dogs": "YES", "cats": "YES"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406620889, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410508889, "id": 1249450874, "price": 1290.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-CHI-BLO", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-CHI", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-CHI-WES", "zipcode": "USA-60108", "long": "-88.108978", "county": "USA-IL-DUP", "state": "USA-IL", "lat": "41.944553", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_kO4kPzg8DVD_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_6AVCjRHb2Xp_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_bwRHhaEcYVP_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_9nn3whZPXaK_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_gFIyGefmphx_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_kDDwEjksOyA_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_B0TsPufV32_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_eAULeEk0R2j_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_g7wkR9mgrsU_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_6C6MLvw6gHG_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_fpaZEUN3ooj_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_doTgGUzzB1F_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_l61GSLRfPGS_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_4wCMGxQtRdB_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4587521321", "heading": "//2BR/1Bath  Stratford Place - Price includes garage space", "category": "RSUB", "external_url": "http://chicago.craigslist.org/wcl/sub/4587521321.html"}], "time_taken": 949.6290683746338, "new_postings": 2447729, "time_fetch": 768.7230110168457, "num_matches": 270074, "anchor": 1258324525, "next_tier": 0}
