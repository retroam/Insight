I am a honest, responsible and respectful 36 year old male who is pretty conservative/libertarian..... Just a little more than your average Chicagoan. Ha Ha! The unit is on the first floor. The master bedroom is available for $800. The room will be available from September 1st (possibly sooner) through September 24th. The bedroom has huge closets and a private bathroom with a large shower and 2 sinks. The master is also large enough for a king bed, furniture and a desk. There is also a bathroom in the hallway which has a shower/bath. The kitchen is open to the living room. Almost everything has been recently remodeled. The living room has doors out to the patio which is super nice with a gas grill! The parking out front is zoned and very easy during the week. The place is also across from Jonquil Park which has lots of non-zoned parking. I have a 6 year old chocolate Lab that is super friendly and quiet, but is a good watch dog as well! My dog is a female and very docile. I also have no issue allowing another well tempered dog! I normally work Wednesdays through Saturdays from 1-11pm. The bills would be about $120(cable TV, internet, electric/gas and water) for your half. I tend to keep the air conditioning on in the summer when I`m around, which is cheap to run. You can hear the \"L\" since the track is nearby, just incase your a super light sleeper. I have nice furniture for the kitchen and living room, also many things will be staying in place. In the summer I spend a lot of time in Lake Geneva with my family and dog. Feel free to ask me any questions personal or otherwise.

The apartment is completely furnished and you have full access to the well-appointed kitchen. There is a half bath available on the third floor; the full bath is on the second floor (which we would share for the shower).\nThe house itself is beautiful and it has a fenced in back yard. The kitchen is modern, including granite countertops. Gas stove so it is great for cooking! There is a large TV in the living room that is a mini home theatre. The house is freshly painted and renovated. Hardwood floors throughout! The house has a balcony and a gas grill.\nI live primarily on the second floor. There is a second bedroom on the third floor and an office on the third floor.\nThe house is conveniently located five minutes to Harvard Yard. It is within 10 minutes of Harvard University (including Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences GSAS, Harvard College, and most departments at Harvard). Also close to Lesley University. 5-8 minute walk to Harvard Square T stop and Central Square. Two blocks away from Cambridge Public Library and Cambridge Rindge and Latin. There is a bus stop in front of the house that goes to MIT and Kendall Square. In sum, the house is very conveniently located!\nAbout your roommate: I am a male late-20s young professional. I work from home mainly. I don`t throw loud parties, although I host a dinner party or two a month. I rarely drink and don`t smoke. I keep to myself. I`m not looking for a best friend, although I do have best friends that started out as roommates. I am very flexible in that regard, we do not have to talk much but we must respect each other`s space.\nAvailable to show immediately. Available on a weekly basis (and perhaps nightly, email me with the details), at $350 per week (negotiable). More pictures available upon request.\nWhen contacting me, please let me know what week(s)/day(s) you are interested in. Available September 1 (may be possible to move in a few days before).

Also, if you have a criminal record of any kind, this isn`t the place for you!\nI prefer a young professional, student, just anyone who has their shit together, is responsible and pays the rent on time and cleans up after themselves. This means not leaving dishes in the sink longer than a day, making the bathroom look like a disaster, etc.\nYou must have steady income, as in have a job and can prove it. Also, I will run a background check on you and require you to submit two forms of government ID. This is just to make sure you don`t have a criminal record.\nNow that all that`s out of the way, I`d prefer someone that`s chill. I may seem like a hard ass, but trust, I am not.
