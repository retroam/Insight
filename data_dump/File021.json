Your kids will feel like woodland creaturesand youll feel like a travel-planning wizardwhen your family settles into our mid-century modern cabin, tucked into a dense stand of redwoods beside the Russian River in Guerneville. (One ancient redwood has been presiding over our part of the forest for over a thousand years!)\nA true mid-century modern gem, Lucky Bend Lookout was architect-designed and constructed in 1966, and is kid-friendly down to the childproofed details. Its environmentally friendly, too. During a recent remodel, we took care to increase thermal performance by 400 percent (that includes heated floors!) and used only sustainable building materials and native plants. Protecting nature which is so gorgeously on display here is a priority for us.\nIn true mid-century modern tradition, the Lucky Bend Lookouts open floor plan, elevated treehouse-style deck, enormous windows, and warm redwood walls and ceilings merge indoor and outdoor spaces.\nHave you ever vacationed somewhere thats brimming with natural beauty and felt guilty for just wanting to relax inside with a good book? Here, thats no dilemma.\nWatch ospreys soar among the redwoods from the couch in the living area, decorated with clean lines and whimsical fabrics. Or saute fresh vegetables from the Guerneville Farmers Market in our fully stocked kitchen as you watch your kids play outside on the deck.\nThen, present your handiwork to your hungry family at the sleek dining table which has room for 10 and watch the Russian River drifting by in the fading light of evening while the adults sip our regions famous wines. Or you can get even closer to nature and feast at the eight-person outdoor dining table on the spacious deck among the trees.\nAfter dinner, get cozy in the living room and watch the stars reflect their sparkle on the river as you browse Netflix, HuluPlus, or Pandora Radio on our 47-inch flat screen TV. The couch doubles as a pull-out bed.\nFor the kids, we keep our cabin clear of breakable knickknacks and stocked with all the gear you need. A Pack n Play, high chair, step stool, potty-chair, toddler bed rail, baby swing, and stroller keep the little ones safe. Plus, we supply a few extra goodies to keep them happy, like a water table, a swing set under the deck, and some inside toys.\nOne bedroom features a reading nook and a sturdy set of bunk beds for a fun, summer-camp setup, except much comfier--we use memory foam mattresses on all of our beds. And your kids imaginations will run wild with the magical redwood grove in view just outside their window.\nTwo adult bedrooms, with queen-sized beds and mid-century modern details like shag carpeting and low-profile beds, invite you to sink in for the night. A view of the redwoods will greet you in the morning.\nDowntown Guerneville is only a mile from the Lucky Bend Lookout. We are located 10 minutes by car from the nearest winery and 15 to 20 minutes from dozens more. Theres even a kid-friendly wineries in the area!

We would be on the top floor of a homey duplex over our very accessible, responsive and KOOKY landlord, his wife and their child. If you like the idea of participating in a community living arrangement, more details are below.\nThe Space:\nThe space is large. It`s got 3 bedrooms and 1 bathrooms with hardwood floors throughout. There are high ceilings, lots of windows & natural light, and authentic 1930`s architecture.. There`s also central air & heating, and out back, there is a utility room with washer and dryer. This gorgeous unit is within walking distance of the Houston Museum of Natural Science, The Med Center, and the Houston Zoo. We are right next to the bike path along N MacGregor Way, and a 15- 20 minute bike ride to U of H. It take about 8 minutes to drive to U of H and we`re next to the #11 bus stop.\nThe Rooms: $500 a piece. There are 3 bedrooms, each very roomy. Here is where the kookiness of the landlord comes in. He is a very private person, and wouldn`t let me take pictures of the place or get measurements. I would estimate that they were about 12` by 12`, but I can`t guarantee it. The master bedroom is a bit larger than the others, but I totally call dibs on it because I got here first, but it evens out because it`s the only one that doesn`t have a closet.\nThe People:\nMy name is Nakia and I love meeting new people! When I have spare time, I like to cook, play board games, read, volunteer, and generally hang out with people and learn new things. However, I`ll be attending grad school this fall, and don`t anticipate having free time to speak of. My betrothed lives in Austin, and will be coming up occasionally to visit me. He`s sweet and way more low key than I am.\nI hope to make a home with my housemates instead of just having a space where were all live. It`s very important to me that we all get along and have fun together as much as possible as 3 people with busy lives can manage. I love having house dinners and wine and fantastic conversations. I really do want to hear about your day and lives.\nYou would need to have the following attributes:\nOpenmindedness - Gay, straight, bi, black, white, brown, trans, tall, short, fat, medium, I don`t discriminate and neither do you.\nMutual Respect - Respect for others and their boundaries is the *minimum*\nCleanliness - Your room can be a mess, but please keep the common areas clean\nResponsibility - You need to be aware that your actions or inaction effects the people around you and be responsible for what you do or don`t do\nDesire to make positive contributions to a harmonious household -I could live with someone who just pays rent & is never home but I want someone who shares the awesome\nBody positive- The space will be clothing optional, I might hang out in a room in my underwear, housemates can walk around with less than towels on. If you tend more towards the prudish, this is not the house for you.\nFriendliness (environmentally or 420 and otherwise) - I want to have positive interactions with you & want you to have them with us!\nSomeone who pays bills on time - This really goes under responsibility, but it`s important enough to list twice\nPet free - I am allergic to any animals with fur or feathers.\nSomeone who has a life - if you aren`t in some way interesting or engaging, then we are probably not compatible.\nConservative with the A/C - I usually have the heat set to come on at 69, and the A/C at 79. This is negotiable, but its part of being environmentally friendly & keeping the bills down.\nDoesn`t watch a lot of television - Although, there is a charge for it, I prefer not to have a television in the house at all. The last 2 houses that I lived in haven`t had TVs in them and we talked to each other instead or read a book. It was great.\nDoes not smoke cigarettes- I allergic & it just smells bad.\nAble to pay your part of the deposit - Which is the cost of the room.\nAn adult, emotionally and biologically. 25+ because, damned kids, get off my lawn! :)\nRent is due monthly of and we will split utilities and wireless internet- the water is shared with the landlord and his family. I haven`t lived there so I don`t know what to expect for utilities yet. The landlord gave me some numbers, that sounded reasonable, but I don`t remember the specifics. Deposit is $670. The room is available on August 8. I would love to meet you! Please send me an email letting me know about you & how awesome you are! I will need to meet with you in person. It`s really important that we do, because it`s hard to get a feel for people over a medium- including skype. I will be in Austin for the next couple of weeks, so if you are too, meeting here is great. If you are only available to meet in Houston, I can arrange to meet many people on one day.\nThank you for reading this far and I hope to hear from you soon!\nIF THE AD IS STILL POSTED, I AM STILL LOOKING FOR A HOUSE MATE.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"source_account": "n2gzv-4582654223@hous.craigslist.org", "source_neighborhood": "museum district", "laundry_on_site": "YES", "year": "1930", "original_posting_date": "1406077595", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+Hermann+at+Almeda+Rd+Houston+TX+US", "dogs": "NO", "street_parking": "YES", "available": "aug 08", "no_smoking": "YES", "private_room": "YES", "source_loc": "houston", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_continent": "USA", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=Hermann+at+Almeda+Rd&amp;csz=Houston+TX&amp;country=US", "no_private_bath": "YES", "sqft": "1800", "source_state": "Texas", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Share a fantastic home with hardwood floors in museum district!", "cats": "NO"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406611120, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410499120, "id": 1248565368, "price": 500.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-HOU-HOU", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-HOU", "locality": "USA-HOU-MED", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-77004", "long": "-95.380549", "county": "USA-TX-ARR", "state": "USA-TX", "lat": "29.717592", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00707_dTl5uz0i02A_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4582654223", "heading": "Share a fantastic home with hardwood floors in museum district", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://houston.craigslist.org/roo/4582654223.html"}, {"body": "&#21333;&#25151;&#38388;&#20986;&#31199;&#65292;&#25151;&#38388;&#22312;&#20108;&#27004;&#65292;&#20301;&#20110;&#24076;&#27963;Hayward.&#36817;580&#65292;880&#39640;&#36895;&#20844;&#36335;&#65292;&#38468;&#36817;&#26377;&#22823;&#22411;&#36141;&#29289;&#20013;&#24515;&#65292;&#31163;&#22823;&#21326;99&#21482;&#26377;10&#20998;&#38047;&#36335;&#31243;&#65292;&#27835;&#23433;&#22909;&#65292;&#29615;&#22659;&#22909;&#65292;&#20809;&#29467;&#65292;&#25151;&#23376;&#26032;&#20928;&#65292;&#21253;&#27700;&#30005;&#65292;&#39640;&#36895;&#19978;&#32593;&#65292;&#27927;&#24178;&#34915;&#26426;&#40784;&#20840;&#65292;&#36866;&#21512;&#21333;&#36523;&#22899;&#22763;&#25110;&#22899;&#23398;&#29983;&#65292;&#23567;&#21561;&#65292;&#26080;&#23456;&#29289;&#65292;&#19981;&#28895;&#65292;&#26377;&#24847;&#35831;&#30005;\n show contact info\n#65292;8&#26376;23&#26085;&#20043;&#21518;&#21487;&#20197;&#20837;&#20303;&#12290;$550/&#26376;", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "eby", "source_account": "c3k7h-4592520335@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_state": "California", "source_neighborhood": "hayward / castro valley", "phone": "8175806529", "source_loc": "sfbay", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "&amp;#25151;&amp;#38388;&amp;#20986;&amp;#31199;"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406611127, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410499127, "id": 1248546291, "price": 550.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SFO-CAS", "geolocation_status": 5, "metro": "USA-SFO", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SFO-EAS", "zipcode": "USA-94546", "long": "-122.07925", "county": "USA-CA-ALM", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "37.69549", "formatted_address": "Castro Valley Boulevard, CA, USA", "accuracy": 7}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_5qNTnbpGJSo_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00707_k7v46UKBAGt_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_e6di1TwmL3g_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_i1wDE3uKSbm_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_f0lxXwZdFh9_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592520335", "heading": "25151;38388;20986;31199;", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/roo/4592520335.html"}, {"body": "$135 / 1br - 600ft\u00b2 - One bedroom Oceanfron Vacation Rental Condo - see Turtles (Lahaina-Kahana).\nAloha and welcome to our comfortable tropical condo, Mahina Surf #113. If you`re looking for a comfortable condo on the West coast of Maui. . . Look no further! The Mahina Surf is located on the West Shore of Maui, between Lahaina and Kapalua, hidden in a small-secluded cluster of private condos, with views of Lanai and Molokai. Just a few minutes ride to the north or south, the resort areas of Kapalua and Kaanapali offer world class golf, tennis, dining, shopping, and a host of beach activities. In the winter months the waters off West Maui play host to migrating humpback whales, putting on spectacular displays - many of which can be seen from our lanai. The property is a low rise complex (56 units) with over two acres of un-crowded space. Throughout the property you`ll find many tropical gardens consisting of pacific rim and native Hawaiian plants. Other property amenities include our ocean side solar heated pool with views of the islands of Lanai and Molokai, pool side tables and chairs for sunbathing or pupu`s, coin operated laundry, free parking and three ocean side complimentary Weber gas barbeque grills. All owners are involved in the care and maintenance of our property and buildings, making Mahina Surf one of the most beautiful properties on the west side. Our condo is on the first floor with amazing unobstructed ocean views from the lanai, living and dining room. Our unit provides easy access to the pool, grounds and parking lot without stairs. From the lanai you`ll find four chairs and a large patio table where we enjoy most of our meals outdoors from our private lanai. Our condo is a one bedroom unit furnished with a Queen size bed, chest of drawers, night stands, closet (with programmable safe), cordless phone, digital clock radio and flat screen TV. Just down the hall is an updated bathroom with a full walk in shower enclosure, sink and mirror vanity and medicine cabinet. We have a fully equipped kitchen recently updated with granite countertops. In the kitchen you`ll find a fill-sized refrigerator, oven, glass cooktop stove, dishwasher and microwave. An ample amount of cookware, utensils and appliances (blender, coffee maker, etc.) are available for preparation of your own meal. Our unit has bamboo wood flooring throughout. The kitchen and dining area lead to a spacious living area with a queen sized sofa sleeper, recliner and chairs. There are several entertainment options available including a flat screen LCD TV, Blu Ray/DVD player, Free WiFi and wired internet and iPod stereo docking station.

Website: http://thesaltaire.com\nIf you need more bedrooms or don`t have a 4 wheel drive SUV The Saltaire Mansion is the home for you! Our street has its own private beach access. If you like being within strolling distance of all the best restaurants, shops and sound front boardwalk Saltaire is centered in the heart of the Famous Duck Village .\nBoth our homes have a Friday to Friday rental weeks in order to save you wasted hours in the weekend traffic. The entire island (400,000+) turns over on Sat & Sun and is funneled into 2 roads.

We do not add on another 20 % of taxes and service fees like other companies, we have already built that into our pricing so that what you see is what you pay.\nSunnybank is 10 minutes from the Food Lion shopping complex offering unlimited shopping, restaurants, bars, golf, etc. The local gas station/store can be accessed in less than 5 minutes.\nRated best undiscovered beach.: Amenities include elevator, Large salt-water pool, Kiddie pool, 2 hot tubs, gourmet kitchen and so much more.

True oceanfront living tempts you to enjoy wild mustangs grazing in your own yard, star lit walks along the beaches, waking up to the surf and exploration of the Sound in a relaxing environment.\nThings to do: Locally, you may want to visit the Whalehead Club at the lighthouse, a turn of the Century hunting `camp.` It`s a restored mansion from the glory days of the great hunt camps of the gilded age. Tours are given daily. Right next door, the Currituck Beach Lighthouse is also open for tours. There`s a lighthouse, keeper`s cottage and a bit of the old Corolla village. The wildlife preserve offers great free activities along with a interesting video and museum.\n2nd Largest Dune on the Eastern Seaboard.: Penny`s Hill Dune, (the Outer Banks second largest natural dune, second only to Jockey`s Ridge) is located almost in your backyard. Savor the water views from every room of this unique coastal destination. Let unsurpassed ocean sunrises and sound sunsets mesmerize you. The local gas station/convenience store can be accessed in less than 5 minutes.

Room is good for only one person and preferably female. Clean and very calm and spiritual atmosphere!\nEven though the general conditions of the condominium are not fancy and modern, and the association is still working to improve how it looks, you may find in our house a nice and safe place to sleep, relax, study and live with up to 3 more responsible, positive, educated and hard working females: another possible tenant, my amazing mother and me. I also have three little dogs living outdoor as my companions and guardians. So you have to be pets friendly. You are free to come by at any moment and see the condominium first to decide if you are still interested.\nOur kitchen welcomes vegetarians and or vegans loving a healthy life style. But if you aren`t, you may still have limited access and prepare not animal based food. Utilities like water, electricity and Wireless internet connection are included. We currently don`t need to have a cable TV service, but we can get it for you if you really, really die for it.\nWe love to live in an organized and well cared home, free of addictions and unnecessary complications. So, if you think and feel the same way take this chance to turn this temporary spot as your home. You may leave at any time, just let us know in advance. This is a simple stress free month to month commitment.\nClose to bus line, Walmart, BJ`s, supermarkets, stores, Target, some dining options, parks, local library, gyms, etc. Depending on traffic we are 10-15 min away from Turnpike expressway, 15-20 min from Miami Dade College.\nWe require a person to person interview to qualify and discuss further important details.\nThe moving in date is flexible. 50% returnable deposit plus first month. Deposit condition could be avoid just if you are an incredible match to my searching requirements. Room available now!\nPlease contact me first by text because I`m working.
