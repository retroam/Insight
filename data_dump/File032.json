She moved back to Japan, so we need a person asap! Hopefully you`ll be a college student or happily working in your chosen field with some direction in your life. I don`t want any fly by night types. We`re hard working professionals so you should be as well. The place is always clean and you should be a relatively clean, respectable person. That said, the room is fully furnished and the apartment is well furnished too.\nThe apartment is located near Fordham University and Pelham Parkway stop on the #2 subway, about 40 minutes from Midtown Manhattan.

If you`re not familiar with the phrase Work Hard, Play Harder or you`re not so interested in making friends with new people in a new city then this might NOT be for you...\nMany folks move to a new city with struggles of finding the social crowd or that first real friend. The concept was created by young professionals and service members for young professionals and service members. We`re not some couple with a spare room or someone who needs help paying the bills. We felt so many people young professionals were moving the Charleston with same situation and common interest so we created the Ultimate Roommate Pad. Our house offers more than a room, however an experience.\nThe Ultimate Roommate Pad is completely furnished with all modern Grade A furnishing.

The patio is definitely a social haven for our popular Wingz Night... cooking up some of the best HOT wings or roasting oysters, light the tiki`s candles and this is the ideal place to relax and chill with friends.\nThe Ultimate Roommate Pad concept creates a hassle free environment. Starting off with rent options - pay $595 or a FLAT rate which includes ALL bills and utilities...so no matter who moves in or out of the Roommate Pad the rate never changes for the duration of your lease. This is a very popular way to go for budgeting and security.

You will never hear someone say we`re out of bathroom tissue. The roommates plan weekend trips, club nights, camping trips, beach day, concert weekends and even happy hour evenings. Most people enter as roommates and leave as friends! Hopefully you can SEE why.\nThe Roommate Pad concept has been going strong for 5 years.... housing over 12 Navy Guys, 10 Air Force, 5 Coast Guard, 8 Marines, 10 CSU/Trident student and 4 Citadels cadets and at over 10 roommates from various professions like Boeing and Bosch. We must say The Roommate Pad is more than just a place to stay, but an experience. The house was created with purpose so it has structure and personality.

This 4,800 sq. ft. property features two detached dwellings which are both included in the one rental fee. The main house has three bedrooms (each with its own separate loft area), gourmet kitchen, game room, and more. The guest house features one bedroom, a loft, and separate kitchen. Wide decks surround the property, offering expansive views of the landscape. This configuration is ideal for families who want to vacation together but still enjoy their own privacy.\nDuring your stay you will have full access to the town`s community beaches. Ride your bike or drive the short distance over. The rental packet includes parking passes good for use at Hillcrest Lifeguard Beach, among other spots. Also included are keys to the community tennis courts. And for boaters, you`ll have privileges to use the Southern Shores Boat Club. Facilities include a boat launch for getting in. Then simply head over to Edgewater and the 24 ft. dock at the end of our pier.\nThe house is conveniently located just over the Wright Memorial Bridge as you enter the Outer Banks from Route 158. This convenient location means you won`t need to fight traffic on your way in or out. Once you reach the Outer Banks, you`re pretty much there!\nAs the photographs show, Edgewater is not your typical `beach box` destination. Vistors experience the best of both worlds: Easy access to the beach and restaurants and shops, combined with the tranquility and natural beauty of the coastline against the backdrop of Kitty Hawk Woods. Watch the sunset over the marsh grass. Listen to the frogs sing. There`s something to be said for open, undeveloped spaces. Soundside sanctuary. Edgewater is that.\nIf you`d rather, you can access the property from the water. We`re just off the inter-coastal waterway on Albemarle Sound. The house has a dock measuring 12 x 24 ft. with sturdy mooring pilings and a wide pier leading to the house. The depth of the water is approximately 3 ft. at the shallowest. The channel is much deeper. Or bring your kayak or canoe and create your own adventure.\nHere`s a brief walking tour of the property:\nWhen you walk in the front door you are met by the vaulted ceilings of the spacious great room, featuring enormous cross beams which were salvaged from an old Pennsylvania barn. The gourmet kitchen is here, with its granite countertops and stainless steel appliances. You`ll notice the cabinets are made of wormy chestnut, an expensive wood which helps set the tone for the rest of the house. There`s a dining table for eight, as well as bar stools at the kitchen counter for five more. The living room area has brown leather sofas and comfortable side chairs, arranged around a 52-inch flat screen T.V. with home theater surround sound. Edgewater is a `smart home` and so you will also find WiFi, televisions, and stereo speakers you can control throughout the two houses.\nLeaving the kitchen area there is a long hallway with three bedrooms and a separate half bath closer to the kitchen. Each bedroom has its own loft with either sleeper sofas or fold out beds. And the water views from each loft are incredible! The first bedroom on your left as you walk down the hall away from the kitchen features a pyramid bunk. This bedroom has shared access to a large bathroom, which adjoins the second bedroom on your left. The second bedroom offers a queen-sized bed. At the end of the hall overlooking the water view is the main house master bedroom, with king-sized bed and deluxe master bathroom.\nWalking out onto the deck from the main house, you find the large hot tub facing the water. To your right, on the same level, you enter the separate guest house dwelling. Through the front door of the detached home, you can go either right or left. To the right is the living room and full kitchen, with spiral stairs leading up to the loft. Windows throughout the house face the water and the marsh, giving the feeling that you`re floating in the nature space. Continue to the left, to the other side of the house, and you find the master bedroom with its king-sized bed and comfortable seating by the windows. The master bath is accessible from both the bedroom and the living room area.\nOn the ground floor is the in-ground concrete pool. Please note that during late fall/winter the pool is closed for the season. Next to the pool you will find the tiki bar and outdoor grill. All is within easy reach of the game room, which boasts a pool table, television, wet bar, and more. There`s plenty of parking, both covered and not. In fact, there`s a two-bay garage at your disposal. Off the parking area behind the house is the long, wide wooden pier leading through the marsh area to the dock. This pier is a wonderful spot for enjoying sunsets and the natural beauty of the Nature Conservancy preserve.\nKeywords: beach house, vacation rental, coast, outer banks, holiday, family, kid friendly, reunion, wedding, retreat, boat dock, waterfront, hot tub, wifi", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"available": "jul 28", "dogs": "NO", "bathrooms": "3ba", "source_account": "hqdr8-4592554867@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "furnished": "YES", "wheelchair_accessible": "YES", "house": "YES", "bedrooms": "4br", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Kitty Hawk", "w_d_in_unit": "YES", "source_state": "North Carolina", "source_loc": "outerbanks", "cats": "YES", "attached_garage": "YES", "no_smoking": "YES", "source_subcat": "vac", "source_heading": "COASTAL WATERFRONT - POOL/HOT TUB/DOCK - "}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406615403, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410503403, "id": 1249255810, "price": 300.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-KID-KIT", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-KID", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-27949", "long": "-75.71517", "county": "USA-NC-DAR", "state": "USA-NC", "lat": "36.09822", "formatted_address": "Outer Banks Visitors Bureau, 5230 North Croatan Highway, Kitty Hawk, NC 27949, USA", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00606_c8tj0rN6GTJ_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00606_97TvVYmTCk4_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01717_5cdp9AtH8sS_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01111_kXmRGiill6p_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_gl7Jf62DwU8_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_hOcMukyUzQG_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_is2df8AsKXS_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00000_4LVJRAL0AqV_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_4w0AV1ZcOP_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_cFncQ8l18cf_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_sZWnW1Oe5K_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_37NtgncEwN6_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_ciei0mGaf9l_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_klatMn2SDRY_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592554867", "heading": "COASTAL WATERFRONT - POOL/HOT TUB/DOCK -", "category": "RVAC", "external_url": "http://outerbanks.craigslist.org/vac/4592554867.html"}, {"body": "Next Opening...

Generally, I`m at out of the apartment 8-6 on weekdays.\nMy friends are great. I like to have them over for dinner parties.\nI cook a lot. I volunteer with a couple Oakland organizations. I read. I run. I am almost always willing to go grab a drink and talk about arts or politics or gossip.\nI`m am reasonably tidy, but not obsessively so.\nI travel for work and fun a fair amount--at least once a month.\nYou:\nI`m looking for a roommate (just one person) who is sociable and wants the apartment to be a place where bookclubs and friends and conversations come together and happen.

Then I have the place for you! I have two rooms available, one available now and the other available September 1st! Both rooms are awesome in a place that has off-street parking, washer and dryer, renovated kitchen, dishwasher and garbage disposal, backyard with fire pit, 4/20 friendly, five minute walk to the 66, 86, and 70 line, stone throw away from Harvard Square, Central Square, and Brighton, and rooming with music enthusiasts!\nThe Place\n------------\nThe place is a 5 person home sharing 2 bathrooms both with showers, (see tenants below). The unit includes it`s own driveway for you to park your car, and only has two tenants thus far that have cars to park at the unit. We are located across from an elementary school, so our street and surrounding streets do not require permit parking. If your friends wish to visit, they can park and stay without worry. We are also a convenient 5 minute walk to 3 different MBTA lines, the 66, 86, and 70. This allows easy access to Harvard Square, Central Square, and Brighton / Allston. The kitchen was renovated a few years ago, and has been able to accompany several pot luck dinners. We also have a backyard with patio furniture where we lay out after work and relax over a few beers.\nWe are also a 5 minute walk to the 66, 86, and 70, which allows easy access to Harvard, Central, and Brighton, which also gives you access to the Green and Red line!\nThe unit itself is owned by a real estate management company, so they take care of the property and needs. They mow the grass in the spring and summer, shovel the front walk in the winter, and even plow the driveway when there`s too much snow. They are also very reliable when it comes to fixing house essentials. Last October our water heater broke, and they came to check it the next morning and replaced it that day. Since they take care of the property, they expect us to do the same.\nRooms\n---------\nBoth rooms are about the same size, 18` x 13` (it`s been a while since I measured), but the $900 room includes a walk in closet as opposed to a standard, 4` x 8` (again guesstimate) closet. The $860 room is available immediately, and the $900 room is available September 1st. Move in requires first month and deposit, which is the equivalent to first month`s rent.\nTenants\n----------\nI`m a 26 year old male currently working as a media project manager for a publishing company that probably ripped you off in college. I`m a huge fan of live music and make it a goal to see a live show at least once a week. I`m not the best chef, but I can follow online recipes at least. Toby is a film and theater major coming all the way from Denmark. Like me, he`s a big music enthusiast and is looking forward to experiencing the venues Boston has to offer. We already have plans to check out the Black Keys, with Cage the Elephant opening for them, this September. Finally, Kledio is 23 year old recent graduate working for a web advertising company. Also a big music buff, but more into the EDM scene.\nWhat We`re Looking For\n------------------------------\nAll 3 of us are very laid back and easy going. What we`re hoping for is to find people who would want to hang out with us after work and chill over a game of Cards Against Humanity or Scribblish when we have some spare time. Male or Female, Gay or Straight, Pets or no Pets, it all doesn`t matter to us. We`re just hoping for people who don`t want to lock themselves in their room 24/7 and would rather hang about with the house.\nSo if this seems to tickle your interest, send me a text / message. Due to time constraints, the rooms will be offered on a first come / first serve basis (first to give a check claims to room).\n----------------------------------------------\nTL&DR - Driveway, Washer, Dryer, Renovated Kitchen, Dishwasher, Garbage Disposal, Backyard, Managed Unit, Plow Guy, Responsive Repair, Large Rooms, 4/20 Friendly, Music Enthusiasts, $860 - Now, $900 - Sept", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"available": "jul 28", "dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "gbs", "source_account": "6tj33-4592555651@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "phone": "8452704695", "no_private_bath": "YES", "sqft": "1800", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Lower Allston", "sale_dates": "2014-08-02,2014-08-09,2014-08-16", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "private_room": "YES", "source_loc": "boston", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+Brentwood+St+at+Franklin+St+Allston+MA+US", "off_street_parking": "YES", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=Brentwood+St+at+Franklin+St&amp;csz=Allston+MA&amp;country=US", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "cats": "YES", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "$860 and $900 in an Awesome Unit"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406615527, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410503527, "id": 1248824367, "price": 860.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-BOS-ALL", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-BOS", "locality": "USA-BOS-ALS", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-BOS-SOU", "zipcode": "USA-02134", "long": "-71.132872", "county": "USA-MA-SUF", "state": "USA-MA", "lat": "42.360145", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_aiFFTDgZEAO_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_d7aNwlFNINN_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01515_iBseIcB6PqG_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_l0uonzfgbDj_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00O0O_hFIs6F0PCGx_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_3TwKG9UfPBK_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_9uJ4SBTztIo_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_cJ5ACzuiaSw_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_qplMRDuSRG_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_8eOAF7XWzhW_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01010_lIX4aBxqGuo_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00202_jfvFW7vh0Ft_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592555651", "heading": "$860 and $900 in an Awesome Unit", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://boston.craigslist.org/gbs/roo/4592555651.html"}, {"body": "About the apartment:\nLarge 2 bedroom 1 full bath for move in beginning of August.\nLiving room/dining room area, sectioned off kitchen.\nLarge windows, sunny apartment\n2 parking spots, one for each person (not tandem parking)\n$795/month + ultilities (~$25-30) = $818 to 823, $700 security deposit\nApt is in a friendly neighborhood close to the following:\n10 min walking to Vons, Subway, Rite Aid, two gas stations, BOA ATM\n15 min walking to Albertsons, Ross, Chase bank, Office Max\n20 min walking to Culver downtown, Trader Joe`s, various restaurants and bars and Metro Expo line\n1 min walking to Big Blue Bus stop no. 12 and 6 (Commuter bus to SMC)\n3 min to I-10\nAbout me:\nI`m a 30 y/o asian female paralegal and work full-time.
