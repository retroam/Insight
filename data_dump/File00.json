The last roommate had sliding doors that filled the walkway perfectly, so using such doors is definitely an option; I also have room dividers you can use, or you can just hang up a sheet - it`s completely up to you. The living room is much larger than the bedrooms, so you`ll have plenty of space, and it has a large window facing CSUF; we`re literally right across the street. Overall, the apartment is pretty chill, we`re easy to get along with, and we respect each other`s privacy, so it`s a comfortable place to live. I`m happy to show the room to anyone almost any day of the week.

When you buy the 2 houses and the 5000 square foot shop, your business can rent the shop from you or to someone else. Home occupations are allowed in this zoning. The shop rental is worth at least $2500. You can rent out the smaller house (currently rented for $1095/month) and live in the bigger house (probably $2000 rental value).\nThe house is located in Pierce County, just North of Lake Tapps in the Dierenger School District. Approximately 10 minutes to Hwy 18 or Hwy 167. Surrounded by acreage sized lots and bordered to the east by 1000`s of acres of open space, this 3 acre home site has a magnificent view of the White River valley, the Cascade Range and Mt. Rainier. Ospreys, Great Blue Herons and Bald Eagles soar over the valley and deer visit regularly.\nOne house is a 1250 square foot (approx.) rambler with a two car attached garage. It is classified by Pierce County as an Auxiliary Dwelling Unit (ADU). It has 3 bedrooms and 1 3/4 baths, a wood stove, vinyl windows and electric wall heaters. It has cathedral ceilings and crown molding in much of the house. It is currently being rented for $1095/month. It was extensively remodeled in 2001.\nThe main house is a 2850 square feet (approx.) two story with a 24`x 25` two car garage. The home has many unique features and architectural elements such as upgraded moldings, curved walls, curved crown molding, venetian plastered walls, 2 story cathedral entry and arched doorways. The uplights, can lights, pendants and sconces can be used to create to wonderfully varied lighting.\nWalk through the formal dining room with its curved walls, past the walk-in pantry, into the kitchen where there is an expansive view of the Cascade Range. In the middle of the kitchen is a 5` x 18` curved island with seating for seven people facing the view, but plenty of room for a huge party.

Wonderful lighting throughout.\nUpstairs are two bedrooms, one full bath and an office with cathedral ceilings, soffit up and down lighting and a beautiful view of the river valley. IN ADDITION: There are two unfinished rooms. Either one could be made into an additional bedroom, OR one of the two rooms has rough plumbing in the walls for a full bath. These two rooms, if finished, would add approximately 480 square feet. The septic system permit was approved for a 4 bedroom house. The house is plumbed and wired for a built-in vacuum and wired for a security system. The house has infloor hydronic (hot water) heating throughout. There are four 66\" x 120\" granite slabs (2cm) available for the kitchen counter tops. This home was built in 2006.\nThe shop is approximately 5000 square feet.
