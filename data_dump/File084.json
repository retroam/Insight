I`ve been here for a year so far, and have had no bad encounters or problems with location, neighbors, management, or maintenance. Rent in my current apartment is $445/month. We pay for Ameren, Cable, and Electricity. Generally, my monthly housing bills are around $340/month, give or take depending on utility variances. Monthly rent split in half is only $222.50.\nCost and location are perfect for any students or younger professionals that need/want to be closer to the west side and downtown springfield.\nI`m a single 20 y/o gay male with no kids or pets (I don`t mind animals, though). I work between 50 and 70 hours a week, so I`m gone a lot. I`m completely accepting of anyone and everyone so long as you`re neat, tidy, and organized.\nI`m EXTREMELY tidy in how I keep my living space, so I expect my roommate to be the same. I live strictly under the lesson that if we clean our messes as we go we don`t have to take time out of our schedule to clean, and a clean home always looks and feels better, anyway. Currently, the unit I`m in has two private bedrooms upstairs with a shared full bath. Downstairs, theres a livingroom, a half-bath, and a kitchen with a front and back door. No w/d hookups, unfortunately, but I believe there are some units available with them, and I would not be opposed to moving into one. Rather, I`d definitely prefer to move to a unit with a washer and dryer.\nThe apartment thus far is fully furnished. The only things that will be missing when my current roommate moves out is a microwave and a TV. Decorations are scarce because I hadn`t planned on being here for another year, but I`m not opposed to decorating at all. Rather, I`d love to actually make the place feel more like a home than like four white walls.\nI would really like to find someone to start talking with and meeting with a few times to get comfortable before making any moves in one direction or another. If I think you`re a good fit, I`d love to get you in here to check out the unit and the area. Please contact me through email or text with your interests, questions, or concerns.\nBelow are a few links with a bit of information on the apartments. You can also find the phone number to the leasing office to ask more questions, as well. Pictures of rooms/space are available upon request.

Utilizing a Regeneration approach to recovery, we provide spiritual and medical solutions to those suffering from substance abuse and co-occurring disorders within a therapeutic community. Our program is a long term treatment-like approach including medical and non-medical detox, crisis stabilization and ongoing care that includes addiction coaching, psychiatric and psychological counseling for co-occurring disorders. Clients learn that a meaningful connection with God through Jesus Christ can provide one with a long lasting recovery and a victorious quality of life that is not taught or accomplished through brief stays in traditional rehabs and treatment centers. Additionally, clients are introduced to the recovery community by attending outside self help meetings such as AA, NA, CA, Celebrate Recovery and others. Although our program is open ended and clients can remain with us indefinitely, current data shows that the most favorable outcomes occur after 13 months of continuing care. We embrace the best practices of medical, spiritual and 12 Step recovery models and work in conjunction with other clinicians and law enforcement to assure the most favorable outcomes. We also offer 3rd party financing with low monthly payments and we accept insurance. Please visit us on the web at HisHouseMinistries.com, then phone us and share your circumstances with us.
