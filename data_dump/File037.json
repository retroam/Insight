So here`s the deal: we (2 guys/2 gals) are looking for someone to live with us in a 5BR house in West Philly. As housemates go, we`re pretty calm, considerate, clean, generally reasonable, and occasionally interesting and fun. If you share some of these characteristics, this could potentially work. Oh, we also have two dogs (Tonka & Tova) and one cat (Payton).\nHere are some reasons you should live with us instead of anywhere else:\n1) Landlord lives on site, so yes, shit gets fixed immediately.\n2) There is a lot to do in the surrounding area. It`s quite `hip`. See below.\n3) Easy parking, gym equipment in the basement, room to grill outside, etc.\n4) Only 22 minutes into the city (15th & Market) by trolley.\n5) We`re not secretly crazy, so far. Although that`s kind of subjective anyway.\n6) There is a chore wheel, and it is enforced with the best of intentions and in a non passive-aggressive manner.\n7) We share food with impunity, supported by a robust accounting system. We`re also pretty good at doing dishes in a timely manner.\n8) There`s a rock climbing/bouldering wall area under the stairs, if you`re into that thing. Use at your own risk. If you`re not into it, too bad, it`s there anyway.\nAnd here is a video of the place... note that it was taken a year ago, before we moved in, and there have been some significant changes since then (e.g. basement is totally redone, rusted fire escape removed, walls painted, we now have furniture, etc.). But at least you can get a sense of the space. The room that`s available is the one on the third floor in the front (see 2:02 of the video).\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7mQQ4J1qik\nAlso, sorry to mislead, but it`s not exactly at 49th & Baltimore - it`s two blocks away. But no one knows where Florence Ave is, and Baltimore sounds better.\nThis also means that you`re two blocks away from...\nMariposa (arguably the best food co-op in the city)\nDock Street Brewery (arguably the best beer in West Philly)\nQueen of Sheba (arguably the best Ethiopian... ok, I`ll stop)\nCurio Theater (Shakespeare plays, cheap)\nA crapload of other bars, restaurants, liquor & beer stores, etc.\n0.5-2 miles (i.e. 5-10 min bike) to:\nUniversity of the Sciences\nDrexel\nUPenn\nBike Score: 97 (Biker`s Paradise)\nWalk Score: 88 (Very Walkable)\nTransit Score: 79 (Excellent Transit)\n[Why don`t all postings have this?]\nInside:\nWasher/Dryer\nBrand new kitchen w/ dishwasher!\nCentral Air (A/C)\nLease Term: $525/month for 1 year. $525 deposit required to move in.\nUtilities: Figure about $75/month for gas, electric, internet.

Currently we live in a HUGE 3 Bedroom/2.5 Bathroom condo in West LA (near Bundy and Santa Monica Blvd). Our roommate is moving out and her room will be available Aug 15, 2014 for move-in.\nTHE TERMS:\n*Rent: $875/month\n*Utilities: approx. $70-$100 (wifi/premium cable/water/power/etc)\n*Security Deposit: $875 ($1750 required on move-in date)\n*Maid: $25 every other month\n*House Costs: approx $25/mo (usually less - for items like paper towels/dish soap and the like).\n*6 Month lease, and a credit check or proof of income (i.e. paystubs).\nYOUR FUTURE ROOMMATES: (We are all asian)\n1. In the master bedroom - Male and Female couple - one is attorney and the other in the fashion industry. Both are in their very early 30`s. They are into being active, cooking, relaxing, but still remain fairly social.\n2. Second Bedroom - Male - he is a very mild mannered roommate. He is in his mid-20`s. He is a student at UCLA from the NorCal area. You would be sharing a bathroom with him (he is very clean and considerate).\nWe like to keep the house vibe mellow. We do not bring the party home, we leave it at the bar. A few friends over for dinner/hang on occasion is no problem, but this is NOT the party spot nor marathon slumber party. We pre-game here on occasion, but typically we like to outsource events like that.\nOUR IDEAL ROOMMATE: A young professional or mature full time grad student. Someone that is CLEAN, friendly, considerate/respectful, on time with rent, non-smoking, and a moderate drinker. Basically a normal person! Neither of the roommates are looking for a new best friend, just a cool and relaxed roommate.\nAMENITIES:\n* a washer and dryer in the unit\n* a balcony\n* full kitchen\n* gated entrance\n* located in a safe area\n*shared bathroom (super clean guy)\n*the bedroom is unfurnished\n*No pets, sorry\n*Street parking only (typically not a problem - the furthest anyone has had to walk was a block...and that was 6 months ago).\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED:\nPlease reply to this post: provide us with a short summary about yourself - be sure to include what you`re looking for, some info about what you`re about, your lifestyle, hobbies/interests, whether you`re working or going to school, and an idea about your schedule.

Looking like a small rancher from the front, this pet-friendly four-bedroom home is perfect for a large family or a large group of friends. The entrance to the luxurious home is not spectacular, but the moment you enter the home, you feel like you have traveled to another world altogether. The living room features an eclectic mix of furniture and colors. The main sofa is multi-colored with interesting patterns. There is a tan leather recliner and a blue-leather stuffed chair with an ottoman in the same colored leather. All these face a flat-screen TV on top of a wooden unit. In a corner of the room is a fireplace on a stone background. The dining-cum-kitchen area of the home is bright and colorful. The dining table is a sturdy wooden one with multi-colored leather straight-backed chairs. There is a door leading from here toward the deck. There is a large glass window on one wall, which ensures a lot of natural light. The modern kitchen is loaded with all the latest amenities and appliances. The first bedroom of the home has a lovely dark wooden queen bed with high headboards. On one side of the room is a window letting in the sunlight. Just below the window is a dark wooden chest of drawers, and next to this, is a high-back stuffed chair. The second bedroom too has a queen bed done in dark wood, with a faux leather cushioned head rest. Both sides of the bed have bedside tables but only one table has a reading lamp atop. A checkered chair lies in a corner of the room. The third bedroom comes with a wooden queen bed and a twin bed. A blinded window dominates one wall and bathes the room in natural light. The fourth bedroom again has a queen bed in dark wood and with a high headrest. A dark wooden high table is on one side of the bed, and the other side has this lovely window that lets you gaze out in to the wilderness all around. This home also has a family room with a wood-burning stove, plush stuffed sofas, and a day bed.\u00a0 With amenities such as large back deck, a two-car garage, great wooded views, wireless Internet, and washer and dryer, this home is convenient and comfortable.
