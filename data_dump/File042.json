Upgraded appliances to include stainless steel appliances, granite countertops, and gorgeous, glossy concrete floors. Large balcony (with direct sliding door access from the living room and from master bedroom). Washer and dryer in unit. Updated/modern light fixtures. Floor to ceiling windows aka lots of natural light. Carpeted bedroom. Huge walk in closet (I`m a girl, it`s huge). The bedroom is unfurnished. The living room is furnished with an L shaped couch, coffee table, side table, a couple lamps, and a 60\" smart HDTV. Dining area is furnished with a table and 4 chairs. There is not much room for living/dining room furniture. Plenty of wall space for wall art!\nMore about the bedroom: large! I have a queen bed, two bedside tables, a large dresser, a bookshelf, and a small ottoman and the room still feels spacious and not at all cramped. The walk in closet has a built in shelving system and is large enough that I was able to put a tall, skinny dresser in there as well. The bathroom is large, updated tile, medicine cabinet, under sink storage, full bathtub, and good water pressure! Floor to ceiling windows give it amazing natural light. As stated earlier, there is a sliding glass door that leads to the balcony.\nAmenities of the building: see apartment`s website http://www.highlandparkdc.com/ but a couple of the best things, rooftop, 24 hour gym, 24 hour super nice front desk staff/concierge, key fob entry. LOCATION. Literally on top of the Columbia Heights metro. Across from IHOP, Panera, Target, 3-4 different banks, CVS, 7-11, The Heights, Starbucks, Chipotle, dry cleaners, pho!, etc. I don`t have a car, want a car, or need one. But it`s also an area full of parking for my friends/residents who do drive.\nYour roommate to be: male, just turned 30, works in hospitality with strange hours, mostly consisting of late nights. One of the most fun, great spirited, responsible people I know. A great friend. Gives plenty of privacy, but down to share an after work conversation over a beer, or grab a bite to eat. Quiet enough that sometimes I`m not sure if he`s home. The only reason I`m leaving this wonderful guy and apartment is simply because I must relocate for work. Your roommate to be is looking for someone who is chill, easy going but responsible, doesn`t mind his strange schedule, is clean and tidy (but not OCD about it), and most importantly pays the bills on time. Most likely no pets, though he miiiiight be able to be talked into it (BIG maybe). Male roommate preferred, though female might be considered.\nDetails on moving in: the date is open, but shooting for Septemeber 1st-ish with the possibility of mod August but I`m not completely sure. I am still finalizing my new spot. The steps you need to take to move in as far as the building is concerned, $250 deposit, and a credit and background check with an application (which wasn`t more than $50 if I remember correctly). My name would then be removed from the lease, and yours would be added. This is not a sublet. The lease is up February 2015.\nRent: $1475 not including electric, gas, or cable/Internet. Water and sewer/garbage are included. All said and done, the total usually ends up around $1550. Parking is available at both the garage attached to the building, and there are others located just across the street for slightly cheaper. I don`t drive/have a car so I`m not sure exactly how much it is a month. But I can of course look into it for you.\nI think that`s all! We hope to hear from you soon! Please don`t hesitate to contact me with any questions, or if you`re interested in checking out the place and meeting your future roommate!", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"bathrooms": "2ba", "source_account": "hvfgd-4592577545@hous.craigslist.org", "source_neighborhood": "Columbia heights metro", "w_d_in_unit": "YES", "year": "2015", "original_posting_date": "1406619650", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+%31%34th+st+nw+at+Irving+st+nw+Washington++Dc+US", "private_bath": "YES", "dogs": "NO", "source_heading": "Master bedroom in 2b/2ba luxury building on top of metro!", "available": "sep 01", "source_subloc": "doc", "private_room": "YES", "source_loc": "washingtondc", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_continent": "USA", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=%31%34th+st+nw+at+Irving+st+nw&amp;csz=Washington++Dc&amp;country=US", "sqft": "1000", "source_state": "District of Columbia", "source_subcat": "roo", "cats": "NO"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406619745, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410507745, "id": 1249255901, "price": 1475.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-WAS-WSD", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-WAS", "locality": "USA-WAS-COA", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-WAS-DIS", "zipcode": "USA-20010", "long": "-77.033257", "county": "USA-DC-DIS", "state": "USA-DC", "lat": "38.928818", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_4ajBxElNkLC_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_bYYzftmawQU_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_cwvl0xegsoz_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_ZB3DNWYQ4A_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_aLTq5kuOHCk_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_2ZyTjANUu1u_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_bYgbw9Bfr6p_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_2QGAM2tanFs_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_2r6FLoIhzhN_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_ld2Tfo5GcLm_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592577545", "heading": "Master bedroom in 2b/2ba luxury building on top of metro", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/roo/4592577545.html"}, {"body": "Two rooms for rent at 5 bedroom home.

Location was great for a Mom with a Berkeley student. The home was clean, comfy, quality and just relaxing!! Our host had parking permits for me so having a car was not a worry. The organic breakfast items were plentiful and fresh!! I would highly recommend staying here!!!! I will be seeing Amy again in the fall!! Thanks!!!\" Brenda R., Massachusettes\nMay, 2014: \"Amy is the best! So friendly, and she really helped me out when i made a small error on my booking dates. The house and room were so well furnished. Lovely organic food and classic furniture. Also- Berkeley is a great place. The house is in between Elmwood and Telegraph, so loads of restaurants and things to do really nearby. This is the perfect place to stay if you`re looking to spend time in the leafy east bay.\" Stephen O., Ireland\nApril, 2014: \"This was my third short stay ... and, again, it was a delight. Amy cares a lot about the comfort of her guests, providing them everything to make them feel like at home, from a vast choice of organic and fresh goodies for breakfast to whatever you would need (or have forgotten) for your stay: towels, hair-dryer, body wash etc... I even found a chocolate from the Easter Bunny with my set of towels, that was so sweet! As always the house was very quiet (despite that all the rooms were occupied this time) and comfy (it felt so good with the cold and gray days we had this end of week!) and the guests very polite. This is my first choice place when I have to come in Berkeley!\" - Stephanie V., USA\nApril, 2014: \"My daughter and I spent 3 wonderful evenings here this past weekend and would absolutely visit again. The location is perfect and in a very safe neighborhood - within walking distance to shops and restaurants. We had breakfast there every morning and were able to cook in the evenings, as the home is equipped with a high end gas stove. I`ve never stayed in a B&B with shared bathrooms, but it was never an issue. It is a well maintained, clean, comfortable and relaxing place to stay. Amy is a wonderful host and very attentive to any needs you may have.\" - Cathy B., So Cal\n\"For my visit to the university, the guesthouse was perfectly located in a very nice neighborhood south of campus. Amy is certainly one of the best organized proprietors I have ever met, so the stay was very pleasant and uncomplicated. Many thanks. If I ever come to Berkeley again, the place is bookmarked.\" - Malte Z., from Germany, December 2013.\n\"The house is quiet, clean, and it is provided with anything you may need. Nice place and very conveniently located to reach the campus.

We`re committed to being good neighbors, and providing all of our guests with a good night`s sleep, so quiet hours (10 pm - 7 am) are diligently preserved.\nVERIFICATION and SPAM/SCAM CONTROL\nBecause of scams and spam, I do not reply to emails without your full name, the dates you`d like to stay, your reason for coming to the Bay Area, and the number of guests.\nRECENT REVIEWS\nMay, 2014: \"Excellent, homey, perfect!!! Location was great for a Mom with a Berkeley student. The home was clean, comfy, quality and just relaxing!! Our host had parking permits for me so having a car was not a worry. The organic breakfast items were plentiful and fresh!! I would highly recommend staying here!!!! I will be seeing Amy again in the fall!! Thanks!!!\" Brenda R., Massachusettes\nMay, 2014: \"Amy is the best! So friendly, and she really helped me out when i made a small error on my booking dates. The house and room were so well furnished. Lovely organic food and classic furniture. Also- Berkeley is a great place. The house is in between Elmwood and Telegraph, so loads of restaurants and things to do really nearby. This is the perfect place to stay if you`re looking to spend time in the leafy east bay.\" Stephen O., Ireland\nApril, 2014: \"This was my third short stay ... and, again, it was a delight. Amy cares a lot about the comfort of her guests, providing them everything to make them feel like at home, from a vast choice of organic and fresh goodies for breakfast to whatever you would need (or have forgotten) for your stay: towels, hair-dryer, body wash etc... I even found a chocolate from the Easter Bunny with my set of towels, that was so sweet! As always the house was very quiet (despite that all the rooms were occupied this time) and comfy (it felt so good with the cold and gray days we had this end of week!) and the guests very polite. This is my first choice place when I have to come in Berkeley!\" - Stephanie V., USA\nApril, 2014: \"My daughter and I spent 3 wonderful evenings here this past weekend and would absolutely visit again. The location is perfect and in a very safe neighborhood - within walking distance to shops and restaurants. We had breakfast there every morning and were able to cook in the evenings, as the home is equipped with a high end gas stove. I`ve never stayed in a B&B with shared bathrooms, but it was never an issue. It is a well maintained, clean, comfortable and relaxing place to stay. Amy is a wonderful host and very attentive to any needs you may have.\" - Cathy B., So Cal\nMORE INFO:\nTake a look: www.homestaybythebay.com\nVacation Rentals: www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p969529", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"source_account": "5w9nh-4588803223@hous.craigslist.org", "furnished": "YES", "house": "YES", "source_neighborhood": "berkeley", "year": "2014", "original_posting_date": "1406405641", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+derby+at+ellsworth+berkeley+ca+US", "dogs": "NO", "source_heading": "BIG, SOUTHWESTERN THEMED ROOM BY DAY OR WEEK", "available": "aug 04", "source_subloc": "eby", "no_smoking": "YES", "bedrooms": "1br", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=derby+at+ellsworth&amp;csz=berkeley+ca&amp;country=US", "source_loc": "sfbay", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_continent": "USA", "sqft": "240", "source_state": "California", "source_subcat": "vac", "street_parking": "YES", "cats": "NO"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406620059, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410508059, "id": 1248759618, "price": 124.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SFO-BER", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-SFO", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SFO-EAS", "zipcode": "USA-94705", "long": "-122.26278", "county": "USA-CA-ALM", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "37.861126", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_jY7H7Y3stwk_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_79SGHFHW2gw_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01010_6FQPEsM2qqR_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_aoM5WK0ujtY_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_bZsUtRF2QNx_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_9TJkPPLztRu_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_55nb2oEXknp_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01313_ifR9isqUagC_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_b8Az20lbmBk_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01111_9VOfkoJcGlP_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00505_hCTiuBqlDT1_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_jsdRh7LrwXX_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4588803223", "heading": "BIG, SOUTHWESTERN THEMED ROOM BY DAY OR WEEK", "category": "RVAC", "external_url": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/vac/4588803223.html"}, {"body": "Alcove Realty\n show contact info\nAlcoveRealty.com\n To View This Property Email this advert or Call\n show contact info\nnbsp;\n CAMBRIDGE - CAMBRIDGEPORT - Price: $2,200 Available 09/01/14 . 1 BEDROOM - 1 BATH Floor#: 3 Remodeled one bedroom with lots of light on the third floor.

The home is located in a mixed residential area, so we prefer quiet, low-key executives/professionals,visiting scholars, or families who keep normal hours.\nNOT A PARTY HOUSE.\nIf you`re looking for a place to party, this is not the place for you. We are located on a quiet, residential street, with school-aged children living next door, and we respect our neighbors` quality of life.\nROOMS and BATHROOM\nThere are 5 rooms which vary in size and share 2 bathrooms (to see them all: www.homestaybythebay.com). Bathroom sharing is made simple with color-coordinated towels matched to your room, towel hooks in your room, toiletry bins in the bathroom, and plenty of extra cabinet and shelf space. None of our rooms have a private bathroom inside them.\nVERIFICATION OR SPAM/SCAM CONTROL\nBecause of scams and spam, I do not reply to emails without your full name, the dates you`d like to stay, your reason for coming to the Bay Area, and the number of guests. You can verify our legitimacy through Google, where you will find us on Yelp, Home Away, Trip Advisor, and other public listings (or see our links below).\nRECENT REVIEWS:\nMay, 2014: \"Excellent, homey, perfect!!! Location was great for a Mom with a Berkeley student. The home was clean, comfy, quality and just relaxing!! Our host had parking permits for me so having a car was not a worry. The organic breakfast items were plentiful and fresh!! I would highly recommend staying here!!!! I will be seeing Amy again in the fall!! Thanks!!!\" Brenda R., Massachusettes\nMay, 2014: \"Amy is the best! So friendly, and she really helped me out when i made a small error on my booking dates. The house and room were so well furnished. Lovely organic food and classic furniture. Also- Berkeley is a great place. The house is in between Elmwood and Telegraph, so loads of restaurants and things to do really nearby. This is the perfect place to stay if you`re looking to spend time in the leafy east bay.\" Stephen O., Ireland\nApril, 2014: \"This was my third short stay ... and, again, it was a delight. Amy cares a lot about the comfort of her guests, providing them everything to make them feel like at home, from a vast choice of organic and fresh goodies for breakfast to whatever you would need (or have forgotten) for your stay: towels, hair-dryer, body wash etc... I even found a chocolate from the Easter Bunny with my set of towels, that was so sweet! As always the house was very quiet (despite that all the rooms were occupied this time) and comfy (it felt so good with the cold and gray days we had this end of week!) and the guests very polite. This is my first choice place when I have to come in Berkeley!\" - Stephanie V., USA\nApril, 2014: \"My daughter and I spent 3 wonderful evenings here this past weekend and would absolutely visit again. The location is perfect and in a very safe neighborhood - within walking distance to shops and restaurants. We had breakfast there every morning and were able to cook in the evenings, as the home is equipped with a high end gas stove. I`ve never stayed in a B&B with shared bathrooms, but it was never an issue. It is a well maintained, clean, comfortable and relaxing place to stay. Amy is a wonderful host and very attentive to any needs you may have.\" - Cathy B., So Cal\n\"I had a great time staying in the Angel Island room. For my visit to the university, the guesthouse was perfectly located in a very nice neighborhood south of campus. Amy is certainly one of the best organized proprietors I have ever met, so the stay was very pleasant and uncomplicated. Many thanks. If I ever come to Berkeley again, the place is bookmarked.\" - Malte Z., from Germany, December 2013.\n\"My mother has stayed ... a few times now, and really enjoys the experience. The neighborhood is appealing. Right around the house it`s fairly quiet, but just 2 blocks away is the Elmwood shopping district, with lots of restaurants, cafes, shops, an indy bookstore and even a branch of the Berkeley Public Library. Good bus transportation within a block. My mother has stayed in a handful of guesthouses over the past two months, and this has been her favorite.\" - Michaela P., Berkeley, CA, November 2013.\n\"My husband and I stayed in the Bayshore Room for several days in August, 2013. We loved the room, which was decorated in soothing tones of cream, blue, and green. The windows on three sides gave us plenty of light and a great breeze. The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of blankets. The house is well maintained and furnished with lots of great old pieces fitting with the period, while the bathrooms are completely updated. [The proprietor] has taken great care with everything. There was plenty of hot water and good water pressure in the shower. This is really important when you`re traveling. ... We would definitely stay at [this] lovely guesthouse again.\" - Naomi L., Chicago, IL, August 2013.\nMORE INFO:\nTake a look: www.homestaybythebay.com\nJoin our network: www.linkedin.com/company/homestaybythebay\nVacation Rentals: www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p969529", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406405601", "available": "aug 04", "dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "eby", "no_smoking": "YES", "source_account": "k33bj-4588802053@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "furnished": "YES", "house": "YES", "sqft": "2560", "bedrooms": "1br", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "berkeley", "source_state": "California", "source_loc": "sfbay", "cats": "NO", "year": "2014", "source_subcat": "vac", "source_heading": "Bright, Sunny Room in Lovely Guesthouse - by Day or Week"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406620063, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410508063, "id": 1248756125, "price": 84.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SFO-BER", "geolocation_status": 5, "metro": "USA-SFO", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SFO-EAS", "zipcode": "USA-94704", "long": "-122.27275", "county": "USA-CA-ALM", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "37.87159", "formatted_address": "Berkeley, CA, USA", "accuracy": 7}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_87BDsw4i5qt_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_db1MZtrWowV_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_4tOKcjSStLZ_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_dK7qcHhgtTG_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_2dm3mkI79QO_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_3iIZ8Lh9v4g_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01313_ifR9isqUagC_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_b8Az20lbmBk_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_elrUH7fbwRZ_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_d7VWcwMI63z_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01717_kan42Q43TYa_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_2TyQCppa9mv_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4588802053", "heading": "Bright, Sunny Room in Lovely Guesthouse - by Day or Week", "category": "RVAC", "external_url": "http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/vac/4588802053.html"}, {"body": "Hi,\nMy lease is up at the end of August and I`ll be moving out-of-town in November.\nI`m looking for a room to sublet within 2 miles of Center City (University City, Grad Hospital, Fairmount, etc.) for September and October.\nIdeally, the cost won`t be more than $500.
