I will be renting out this room while I live elsewhere. It is very spacious, with 3 windows and a sliding glass door that goes straight to the backyard. Almost like a studio/living room to yourself.\nLooking for someone to rent it out, anywhere from a few months to 6 months. I would prefer someone to stay the full 6 months but will be ok with less, like 3 months. The lease is month-to-month, so you week not be trapped in any lease, but you are required to give a 30 day notice if deciding to move out.\nThe room is partially furnished with dressers, closets and a queen bed frame (no mattress or box spring, so you would need to bring your own queen mattress, purchase one, or bring another bed and I can remove queen frame from room). If you absolutely do not want anything in the room, I can store it all in my garage and rent it as unfurnished.\nThe photos show the room with it completely empty. I installed a sink after I took the photos, so you will have your own sink and medicine cabinet in the room. The bathroom to take showers will be shared with 3 other roommates in the house but because of everyone`s different work schedules, there has never been a problem with sharing the bathroom and getting shower time. Room and house have tile flooring. I will try and get more photos up but you can text me or email me to request some additional photos.\nEveryone living here is a working professional, they do there own thing, and just looking for someone else to fit in while I am not living there. Mixed with both male and female. Perfect for military who are only here temporarily or anyone else that is looking for a place to rent short term in San Diego. House is near the 15, 163, 805 and 5 freeways. Plenty of shopping centers, restaurants, movie theater, bowling alley and more in the neighborhood.\nRent is $750 and includes ALL utilities: turbo high speed wireless internet, cable, water, electric\nDeposit is only $250\nOne person to the room only, no exceptions.\nYou will have your own parking spot in the driveway. No garage space or storage available except in your room, which has plenty of space.\nNo drugs (including no marijuana), no pets, no parties, no drama!

Option 2: If you do pay the security deposit, it is $380/mo per person. *These prices are not including PG&E and internet.* The reason for these prices is because if there are 5 people living in the same townhouse, the 2 people will be taking up roughly 32% of total living space in the apartment.\n~~ We are willing to negotiate these prices ~~\nYou will be living with 2 boys and 1 girl (sharing the bathroom/floor with the girl so female strongly preferred)\nIf you are interested, please do not hesitate to respond to this ad so we can set up housemate interviews to allow us to get to know each other better.

Or are you gainfully employed and graduated, now staring into the abyss of Adulthood and need a warmly lit basement cave to squirrel away the last vestiges of your youth?\nDo you want a convenient cat to hold close to your heart, whose warmth will briefly ward away the cold fingers of Responsibility and Pending Deadlines before he wriggles out of your grasp and bolts away (like your dreams, your hopes) leaving behind only dander and a cloud of fur as ephemeral as your happiness?\n(&#9697;&#8255;&#9697;&#10047;) ~~ (&#8857;&#8255;&#8857;&#10047;)\nHello, friend. Let us cry together.\n~~~~~~~\nLOCATION: New Westminster - West End, 10 min walk from 22nd Skytrain. VERY quiet/safe suburban area. Single bus to Uptown New West (Royal City Centre mall + other shops on 6th&6th), or walk downhill to 22nd Skytrain and 1 stop to New West Station (New West Quay market, plus shops/theatre in station).\nHOUSEHOLD: Basement suite (ground level) - you get your own room (unfurnished), shared bath/kitchen, open den. It`s not the largest or prettiest suite but it`s comfortable! Also you`d live with me, and I`m excellent. If you drive your own vehicle, street parking available. Laundry/dryer on-site. Internet/Wi-Fi included.\nPICTURES: What the hell is shibe saying? You can thank Craigslist for the jpeg artefacts. Email to ask for a link of higher-res pictures and more appealing shibe.\nRENT: $450\nDAMAGE DEPOSIT: $225\n*MUST be a cat lover - I have 1 large black cat who is VERY friendly and social, and will absolutely get all up in your business.\n*CANNOT bring in your own pet (single-cat home, sorry).\n*OLDER STUDENTS or Non-Students, please! Emotional maturity and stability needed; a bold heart ready to face demons optional.\n*Ideal for grad students or young professional freelance artists who work from home - my friend and previous roommate is a pro comics artist, and found the quiet and low-maintenance nature of the space conducive to work. Cat will provide reminders that you`re working too much by barging into your room and yelling. He`s good like that.\n*Best for another like-minded geeky/arty person: there are comics/comic works everywhere here and I love to share them. I have cried over the Captain America films, and you will never shame me.\n*An individual who highly values a quiet, safe respite space of a home is required - the landlords and I want to keep this a nice and chill place.\n*No gender preference, guys and gals and non-binary folks welcome.\n*Intersectional feminist LGBT-friendly home. I`m not asking for an essay on Audre Lorde, but I am checking that you won`t be a dick. If these are nonsense words to you, let us pass like two ships in the night.\n*Per the above, MRAs, TERFs, bronies, and Benedict Cumberbatch stans need not apply. &#9829;\n*MUST have references (proof of employment + past landlord/character references).\n*MUST be super clean & fastidious, responsible with respecting shared spaces and keeping it neat/presentable. Be clean like shibe.\n*NON-SMOKER, NO DRUGS, alcohol only in reasonable amounts to help face the yawning chasm that is an uncertain future.\nPlease inquire through email only.
