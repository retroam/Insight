It`s a 2 bedroom apartment on the 4th floor of a walk-up. The location is incredible. The 6 and NQR trains are a 2-3 blocks away. Soho and Little Italy are also a couple blocks away. Fyi, the area is very safe :)\nThe apartment:\nIt`s small, but functional and pretty cute actually. We have a small kitchen and living room. There`s no laundry in the building :( There`s a tv in the living room, but we currently don`t pay for cable tv--which could change if you`d like.\nAlso, we have some really cool neighbors that live right next door. I hang with them from time to time.\nYour room:\nBig enough to fit a queen-sized bed, but might be a bit tight (I have a full-sized bed in mine). There`s also a closet and enough space for a dresser.\nMe:\nI`m a 26 year old working professional. I love my job and work a lot. Aside from that, I work out 3-5 times a week. I`m originally from SF and I`ve been in NYC now for 2.5 years (and love it!). I`m easy-going and a happy person. Life is too short to sweat the small stuff, seriously &lt;3\nYou:\nPreferably a female in your mid-20s or older. Please be super, super cool. Having a chill demeanor is a MUST. No drama, no fuss please :) Please have a stable job, be respectful and clean up after yourself.\nPlease include a link to your Facebook/IG/Linked In. Unfortunately, you probably won`t here from me if you don`t (sorry!).\nDetails:\n\u2022 $1225 per month (I pay the same)\n\u2022 Deposit is equivalent to 1-2 x $1225 (dependent on the property management company)\n\u2022 September 1st move in\n\u2022 We`re required to sign a 1 year lease together (if you choose to move out before it expires, that`s ok)\n\u2022 Utilities run anywhere from $20-$60 per person\nI`m traveling for work right now, but will be back on August 3rd. So please be available to meet up around then :)\nThanks so much and happy hunting!!\n-Ruby &lt;3", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406612646", "source_subloc": "mnh", "source_account": "fknfz-4592534313@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "cats": "NO", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Chinatown / Lit Italy", "source_state": "New York", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=40.718500&amp;lon=-74.002500&zoom=16", "source_loc": "newyork", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@40.718500,-74.002500,16z", "source_subcat": "roo", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "dogs": "NO", "source_heading": "Chill Roommate Wanted for Sep. 1st Move In"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406612840, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410500840, "id": 1248755627, "price": 1225.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-NYM-NEY", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-NYM", "locality": "USA-NYM-TRI", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-NYM-MAN", "zipcode": "USA-10013", "long": "-74.0025", "county": "USA-NY-NEW", "state": "USA-NY", "lat": "40.7185", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_bccfOsp6b9e_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_espO0KHigpe_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_7BjEU5UWZMV_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592534313", "heading": "Chill Roommate Wanted for Sep. 1st Move In", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/roo/4592534313.html"}, {"body": "$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ ~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~\n~!~!~@@~~~Located on Eastern Pkwy & Kingston ave.\n~!~!~@@~~~2 minute walk to subway ( 2,3,4,5 trains )\n~!~!~@@~~~Laundry in building\n~!~!~@@~~~Gym room\n~!~!~@@~~~Backyard\n~!~!~@@~~~SS Appliances, Hard Wood Floors.\n~!~!~@@~~~Great location, very close to stores and train\n~!~!~@@~~~Pets ok!\n~!~!~@@~~~NO FEE\nto schedule a viewing please call or text\n show contact info\n ~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~~!~!~@@~~~ school think thought now have tree page will it him well had are near said plant point see learn it late off his one only try same story take home from great eye work add part back boy man add why air they new don`t I us make will start little same no made name man word he name she hard if may the so will has here can sun kind as life sound with hand few many had name light school up with mother use play when as late", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1405223223", "available": "jul 12", "dogs": "YES", "apartment": "YES", "bathrooms": "1ba", "source_account": "qpf4j-4566405762@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "phone": "3474709076", "source_subloc": "brk", "bedrooms": "2br", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Crown Heights / 2.3.4.5 trains", "source_state": "New York", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?addr=Eastern+Pkwy+at+Kingston+ave&amp;csz=Brooklyn+ny&amp;country=US", "source_loc": "newyork", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+Eastern+Pkwy+at+Kingston+ave+Brooklyn+ny+US", "street_parking": "YES", "latlong_source": "In Posting", "cats": "YES", "source_subcat": "apa|abo", "source_heading": "^^^ NICE MODERN 2BR APT ^^^"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406612844, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410500844, "id": 1248868573, "price": 2200.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-NYM-BRL", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-NYM", "locality": "USA-NYM-BDS", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-NYM-BRO", "zipcode": "USA-11213", "long": "-73.942196", "county": "USA-NY-KIN", "state": "USA-NY", "lat": "40.669403", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_2QpwaaKULFP_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_643Ay5SMPAx_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_eJzhfdGSU7M_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00G0G_3FoUKYGFWcU_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01313_ds8QhSOOhF0_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00303_cqom7Bxupnq_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00000_hBmBEMmIH8U_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_b63XQxqkqtl_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_iDsXUGPM53y_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_dRJ9cksEbBJ_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4566405762", "heading": "NICE MODERN 2BR APT", "category": "RHFR", "external_url": "http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/abo/4566405762.html"}, {"body": "Alcove Realty\n show contact info\nAlcoveRealty.com\n CAMBRIDGE -

If you are NOT a responsible adult/s then you can stop reading now and move on.\n FAQs\nAm I able to lock my bedroom door when leaving? Yes\nLaundry on site? Yes\nOff-street parking? Yes\nPrivate room? Yes\nPrivate bath? Yes\nHow do I enter the property? You will be given a remote control for the electric sliding gate entry on to the property.\nMay I have company? Yes of course, gezz this is not a prison. You will be responsible for your company and their actions however.\nKitchen privileges? Yes, the nicely equipped kitchen has just about anything you need to cook with. Trust me you will be impressed. Note: If you are still reading then you know you will be expected to clean up behind yourself.\nCan I have pets? Sorry, no pets of any kind, I have two dogs so if you are NOT dog friendly, then this is a good time for you to STOP reading.\nI smoke, but not in the house, can I smoke? Sorry, no smoking of any kind on my property anywhere.\nWhat expectations do you have of the tenant?\n House Rules\n1. You must wait for the sliding gate to fully close before taking off down the street. Why? So my dogs do not run away. What if I don`t want to wait because I am in a hurry? No problem, you will have to park outside on the street permanently! Off street parking is a privilege not a God given right. Like all privileges, they can be taken away.\n2. I pay all utilities therefore, you need to act like a responsible adult, by turning off the air-conditioner prior to leaving for work. If you get caught I will give you a friendly reminder, as everyone forgets sooner or later. Do it a second time and I lock-out the air-conditioning. Again, air-conditioning is a privilege not a God given right. Like all privileges, they can be taken away.\n3. You will be expected to be employed away from our home vs working from home.\n4. You will be expected to pay the rent on time. I have bills just like you do.\nOk, for those few that are still reading, you are most likely just like me and my lovely wife, clean, respectful, considerate, trustworthy, sense of humor, etc. We truly welcome you into our home. Your privacy will be respected, when you want to socialize you know where the kitchen and living room is and know you are quite welcome. We don`t care if you are lesbian, gay, straight or alien.\nWe enjoy a glass of wine and stimulating conversations. Great food is always welcome, so bust out that favorite recipe and we will do the same. We have each others back in this household, need someone that is home to keep an eye on a FedX or some other delivery, that is what we do here.\nWe buy our eggs from the local egg farm, so that could be an option to go in together on purchases.\nThat`s it, we look forward to sharing our home located on 1 1/4 acres, with fresh garden vegetables.\n63 inch plasma TV in the living-room coupled with a surround sound system that rivals theaters. Got the Xbox, Apple TV, and Direct TV. Granite counter tops, convection micro-wave, smooth top oven with convection. Wrap around lanai on second floor. Personal gym down stairs.\nLastly, no emails please, serious enquirers only, and respond only with your contact no. and the best time to call you.\nThank you for your time. :)", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1405401776", "dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "oah", "source_account": "zbsnj-4569623135@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Leeward Side", "source_state": "Hawaii", "source_loc": "honolulu", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Private Room and Private Bath Country Living"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406613096, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410501096, "id": 1248593056, "price": 800.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-HIO-HOL", "geolocation_status": 5, "metro": "USA-HIO", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-HIO-BIG", "zipcode": "USA-96725", "long": "-155.66586", "county": "USA-HI-HAW", "state": "USA-HI", "lat": "19.54292", "formatted_address": "Hawaii, HI, USA", "accuracy": 7}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_aM5ge0JVtqJ_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_9f3XtCiSpsg_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_eZpFdwv2pdo_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_f1ZQ5kjxPI0_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_a3jJr4BOiA_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_gyxe3IMMOgT_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00000_ax7DUcdHs2e_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_gn2Q8DZYmhS_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01717_sgQSl065gJ_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_ieKxv1tTFjt_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01111_hoGZvI0JSH8_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_lkpVL8xzGM8_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_cRAv1fE0nEA_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_8kPQfmiQIW1_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00w0w_YVZ6nCp7U9_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4569623135", "heading": "Private Room and Private Bath Country Living", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://honolulu.craigslist.org/oah/roo/4569623135.html"}, {"body": "We have a large, deluxe lofted one bedroom unit, on 2 levels with an open concept.\nIt has a full kitchen with lots of counterspace, double kitchen sink and dishwasher.\nIt is perfect for a couple, but can sleep up to 4 people.\nHigh cathedral ceilings, mountain views, river rock gas fireplace, ski storage room, hot tub, outdoor heated swimming pool, bbq`s, FREE secure underground parking, and washer/dryer in the building.\nAll in a newer complex located just across from the Creekside gondola (less than 90 yards/meters).\nIt is also just across the street from restaurants, pubs, grocery stores, liquor store, bank, Starbucks, Whistler guest services, kids ski school, ski rentals etc...\nOutdoor heated pool, hottub, sauna, FREE secure underground parking, secure ski storage, secure bike storage room, large lobby area, etc ....\nOur Lodge is easy to find and is setup well for the ease of unloading your baggage.
