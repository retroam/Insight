First of all he is skilled manipulator into \"charming\" Joselin Rodriguez`s mother into (Ramiro Rivera Carranza girlfriend) staying at the place for free while the rest of us must work just to pay rent, so expect favoritism and no kind of \"equality\" at this house. We suspect he steals food from other tenants, he ate my friend`s and I`s expensive large party cater tray of Korean rice noodle and duck worth approximately $80.00!!! My friend and fellow roommate is in the reserves and has been serving faithfully for approximately 18 years! Ramiro Rivera Carranza has a criminal history and is suspected to have a warrant for his arrest has as would be expected has an implacable deviously vindictive animosity towards authority figures. He constantly harasses the Army reserves roommate taunting him and hazing him as a ploy to kick him out, My Army reserve friend unfortunately suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and has his beloved Wounded Warrior`s dog companion to help him through his psychological burdens, Ramiro Rivera Carranza and his girlfriend Joselin Rodriguez purposefully with premeditated malicious intent let his service dog out not once but twice!! Ramiro Rivera Carranza said it is not his dog it is not his problem and could have careless about the service dog`s welfare. Ramiro Rivera Carranza is an unrepentant narcissistic, exploitative sociopathic liar and a thief. We suspect that Ramiro Rivera Carranza tried to on multiple occasions to break into the Army Reserves` room to steal his guns; he even broke into the window!!! So not even your room is a safe sanctuary from Ramiro Rivera Carranza!!! There are 7 people that live here and the kitchen is crawling with filthy cockroaches!!! The rent maybe cheap as the deposit but the value and the criminal landlord are not worth it, remember if it is too good to be true it is!!\n I had an interesting email about Ramiro Rivera Carranza:\n Subject: Re: Don`t Rent From Landlord Disrespectful Towards An Army Veteran!!!!!\n Date: Thu, Jul 24, 2014 9:49 am\n ________________________________________\n He [Ramiro Rivera Carranza ] went out with Brenda, they broke up because he went to Brendas mom house and stole their 50\" Samsung Plasma.... He thought he wasn`t gonna get caught. Plus he stole other small stuff from the family.. Including a salmon fish lol, my friend had that for a family dinner but he stoled it smh, he does have a warrant... And was selling drugs thats y he don`t work. &steals he`s a complete moron, loser! Brenda knew better! Idiot is a crook!\n ***We are being lectured about privacy, respect, and manners by a hypocritically arrogant prima donna [Joselin Rodriguez] who does not practice what she preaches who both her and her wretched boyfriend have been in prison before and Ramiro Rivera Carranza a criminal who has a warrant for his arrest and harasses and instigates fights with the other tenants!***\n small Room for rent available ! SINGLE person $300 including utilities such as cable, free wifi, water, trash.. kitchen and bathroom shared. DEPOSIT $100. Parking on street, NOT on drive way. Close to three shopping centers, including ralphs, shell, bus transit, walmart, 711, starbucks, and mcdonalds etc.. next to the 76 and mission ave.\n Rent is due the 1ST like everywhere else NO EXCEPTIONS.\n Family is friendly and my mother only speaks spanish but everyone else is bilingual.\n We have pets, but NO other pets welcomed.\n NO SMOKING/SMOKERS!\n No alcoholics\n Someone that is respectful towards other peoples food, people & their privacy, and my pets.\n Someone that cleans after themselves.\n Know the meaning of renting a room and renting a house.
