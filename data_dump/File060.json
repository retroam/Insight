We are a democratically-run and diverse community that relies on the active participation of our members. We strive to be a supportive, fun, and ecologically-responsible place to live. We appreciate your interest in becoming a member of the Rochdale. The Rochdale has an average of 12-13 members, and provides a cooperative living environment (private bedrooms, shared kitchen, bathrooms, common areas, house meetings and duties).\nWe are a diverse community and value our diversity. The Rochdale Co-op does not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, color, family status, ethnicity, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, religious background or religious affiliation.\nPlease note that the application process requires a face to face interview in New Haven with the members of the co-op, and the entire process can take several weeks.\nThe application process is as follows:\n1. Based on your application and room availability, we may invite you for an Applicant Meeting. The meeting is a chance for you to meet the house members and learn more about our co-op. It also gives us a chance to get to know you better.\n2. Three days after the meeting, we hold a blind vote. If 75% of all current house members vote yes, then we offer membership to the applicant. Since 75% is a high threshold, even very good applicants sometimes don`t get accepted.\n3. New members are expected to pay a security deposit and move in within six weeks of acceptance.\n4. If there are no openings at the time you submit an application, then we will hold on to your application for three months and notify you if an opening occurs. We encourage you to check in after three months if you have not heard from us and wish to re-apply.\n5. If you are denied membership, then you may re-apply in six months.\nWe encourage you to convey any information that you feel is relevant in the application below. Please complete all of the sections in the application and provide as much detail as possible. Electronic applications (sent as the body of an email) are strongly preferred.\nROCHDALE CO-OP MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION\nName:______________________________________\nApplication Date: _____________________Phone:______________________\nAddress:___________________________________________________________\nEmail:_________________________________\nWhen would you like to move in? ___________________________________\n1. Please provide a brief personal history, describing your employment, education, travel, interests, and anything else you think is important.\n2. Please describe any experiences you have living with a group.\n3. Please indicate any special skills, qualities and strengths you would bring with you to the Rochdale.\n4. Why do you want to live in the Rochdale? How would becoming a member fit into your current goals?\n5. A key part of our mission is to provide affordable housing to the New Haven community. We encourage people of all income levels to apply, but also are mindful that a specified proportion of our members should be in the \"low\" or \"very low\" income categories. Thus, while income is not always a factor, it can sometimes affect our decision about an application. Please check the category below that applies to you. Upon acceptance, we will ask for proof of income (i.e. recent tax return, pay stub).\n___ annual income greater than $43,050\n___ annual income between $27,400 and $43,050\n___ annual income less than $27,400\n6. Please indicate your source of income.\n7. Please provide at least two references (professional or personal), including contact information and indicating their relationship to you.
