It has a door that closes and locks. It also has an exhaust fan installed in the wall and wooden floors. There is extra storage in two small storage lofts and shelving in the common space. It has been occupied by painters, jewelers, a glass electro-plater, and a violin maker. There is no central heating in the building, but this particular studio heats up well with a space heater. Electricity varies with each tenant, but I`d say the average has been about 15-30 dollars a month in the coldest part of the winter.\nIf you`re interested, call or email Susanna to schedule a viewing.\n$245./mo. plus electric, 24 access, no live-in, no smoking, dogs are welcome.", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1406438482", "dogs": "NO", "source_subloc": "see", "source_account": "kcksc-4589383182@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "sqft": "105", "bedrooms": "studio", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Greenwood", "source_state": "Washington", "phone": "2064199178", "source_loc": "seattle", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "off", "source_heading": "Art Studio plus Common Space"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406619196, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410507196, "id": 1248764952, "price": 245.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-SEA-TAO", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-SEA", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-SEA-TAC", "zipcode": "USA-98433", "long": "-122.60741", "county": "USA-WA-PIE", "state": "USA-WA", "lat": "47.09586", "formatted_address": "Tacoma Avenue, Fort Lewis, WA 98433, USA", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_csi5LK8n4c9_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01414_iTBXGrpqrE1_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_iC5d3L6WgYm_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_33mdNYpU13a_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01313_53sm9OCC5me_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4589383182", "heading": "Art Studio plus Common Space", "category": "RCRE", "external_url": "http://seattle.craigslist.org/see/off/4589383182.html"}, {"body": "This is a great Mid Century stunner, recently completely refurnished to add even more comfort and upgraded HDTV`s 50\" throughout.

My move out date is flexible, but I would like to fill the room sooner rather than later.\nThe Apartment:\nHUGE and fully furnished. You would be taking over the master bedroom that has its own bathroom, walk in closet and balcony. If you need bedroom furniture I can sell you mine or I can take it with me (see photos). The apartment had a large kitchen (modern appliances), dry bar, washer & dryer in the unit (I repeat IN THE UNIT!) and additional balcony off the living room. The complex has a pool, gym and you would have a gated parking spot.\nThe Roommate:\nOne of my dear friends in her late 20`s who loves the batchelorette, going to barry`s bootcamp and drinking wine. She works in the area, but often stays at her boyfriends house, so you would have the apartment to yourself a few nights a week. She likes to keep the place clean and leave shoes at the door. Usually goes to bed around 11pm during the week.\nYou:\nPreferably a female in mid 20`s to 30`s. Should be respectful, responsible (no drugs) and clean (do what you want with your room, but the common areas should always be reasonably clean). Friendly, easy going and drama free. Able to communicate well. Ideally, working full time and must be able to pass a credit check with building management.\nNote:\nI have lived here for almost 2 1/2 years and have absolutely loved it. Larchmont Village is only a mile away so I love to walk to the Farmers Market there on Sundays. There are also a few restaurants you can walk too and Paramount Studios is 2 blocks away. If you feel like you would be a good fit and are interested please email me your story and a link to FB, LinkedIn or Instagram so I can confirm you are a real person.\nRENT: $1,100\nMONTHLY UTILITIES: Around $150\nLEASE: until June 2015", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"latlong_source": "In Posting", "source_subloc": "lac", "source_account": "nhznk-4592576985@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_neighborhood": "Hollywood", "source_state": "California", "source_map_yahoo": "http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=34.081740&amp;lon=-118.312240&zoom=16", "source_loc": "losangeles", "source_map_google": "https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@34.081740,-118.312240,16z", "source_subcat": "roo", "year": "2015", "cats": "NO", "dogs": "NO", "source_heading": "Master Bedroom in 2 Bed/2 Bath Apartment (Available Now) "}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406619534, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410507534, "id": 1248755135, "price": 1100.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-LAX-LSN", "geolocation_status": 3, "metro": "USA-LAX", "locality": "USA-LAX-MIW", "country": "USA", "region": "USA-LAX-CEN", "zipcode": "USA-90004", "long": "-118.31224", "county": "USA-CA-LOS", "state": "USA-CA", "lat": "34.08174", "accuracy": 8}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_23ATudoUxWk_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_l7qOMvoa4AA_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_gq9fz44CkFa_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_59k4FCGezc0_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_58Oh5y6z54_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_aLTRUlo7f6n_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01212_iFGagtAqY1a_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00E0E_k6Q6co3KVb9_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_OabgKTNoG9_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4592576985", "heading": "Master Bedroom in 2 Bed/2 Bath Apartment Available Now", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/roo/4592576985.html"}, {"body": "Hello, I am a 50 yr old man, recently separated, work,drive, can pay 1st/last, and commit to a long term for the right place.\nI am a cigarette smoker, and looking to smoke inside.

Ideally I am looking for a male or female roommate in their twenties. I am moving to Kansas in August to attend Johnson County Community College and also work at the college for a year.\nI would like to look for a 2 bedroom apartment/duplex. It would be amazing if it was a 2 bath too, but that isn`t necessary. I have three cats so it would have to be a pet friendly apartment. Ideally I am looking in the $750-$950 range (that`s total, not per person - $375-$475 per person). I have found a few great options in the Olathe/Overland Park/Shawnee area, but I haven`t signed a lease for a 2 bedroom yet because I don`t have a roommate yet. Here are two I found:\nhttp://priebpropertymanagement.com/Clinton_Duplexes.php - $695 a month duplex with 2 bedrooms and 1 bath\nhttp://priebpropertymanagement.com/Merriam_Duplexes.php - $795 a month duplex with 3 bedrooms and 2 baths\nAs far as living conditions, I will be going to school and hopefully working a lot. I like a clean place to come home to though. I am not a clean freak, but it would make me happy if I didn`t find a bowl of old ice cream molding under the couch. I believe that cleaning duties should be shared. I have had roommates that have NEVER cleaned. With dishes, as long as there are not foreign bodies growing in the glasses I think we`ll be fine. If you smoke you`d have to do it outside of the apartment. Also, I don`t party (except for maybe a Christmas or barbecue party with my roommate and friends) just out of respect for my roommate`s space and quiet time. If you want to have friends over GREAT! I would love to have a social roommate and not one who just disappears into their room. However, I also would appreciate if there weren`t 8 people over until 4:00AM in the middle of the week. I think all of the above is just common sense and good to have out in the open.\nJust a little bit more about who I am: I grew up in little town North Dakota. I went to college there for 2 years and worked on a Music Theory and Composition major. My junior year, I moved to Minneapolis and attended the Institute of Production and Recording in downtown Minneapolis where I earned my degree in Media Arts and then went on to earn my bachelor degree in Media Business. I also currently work full time at the Institute of Production and Recording. As you probably figured out, I thoroughly enjoy music. I also love every single kind of animal there is. I grew up on a hobby farm. I am going to JCCC to complete some pre-requisites for the biology degree I am looking to earn. I can quote Seinfeld pretty much line for line. Due to that I have a sarcastic sense of humor. I enjoy doing graphic design for a few places as a bit of freelance work. I love to paint/draw and currently teach classes for it. In addition to all of the above, my favorite thing to is go camping, hiking, rock climbing, etc. I am very an organic vegetarian, but have never not lived with a meat eater. I also strongly believe in being environmentally friendly so if you recycle we should get along. Also, I will be working for JCCC`s campus newspaper while going to school.\nIf you are also looking for a roommate and feel we could be a good fit, please feel free to email me, Shannon, at the email listed at the top of this post. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.\nIf you want more information about me you can check out my Facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/shannondhone", "status": "for_rent", "annotations": {"original_posting_date": "1405463422", "dogs": "NO", "source_account": "p8g6v-4570874492@hous.craigslist.org", "source_continent": "USA", "source_cat": "hhh", "source_state": "Missouri", "source_neighborhood": "Overland Park or Kansas City", "source_loc": "kansascity", "cats": "NO", "source_subcat": "roo", "source_heading": "Looking For Roommate 2 Bedroom Apartment"}, "language": "EN", "source": "CRAIG", "deleted": false, "timestamp": 1406619565, "category_group": "RRRR", "expires": 1410507565, "id": 1248756212, "price": 400.0, "currency": "USD", "state": "available", "location": {"city": "USA-KAN-KAN", "geolocation_status": 5, "metro": "USA-KAN", "locality": "USA-KAN-CEU", "country": "USA", "zipcode": "USA-64106", "long": "-94.57857", "county": "USA-MO-JAC", "state": "USA-MO", "lat": "39.09973", "formatted_address": "Kansas City, MO, USA", "accuracy": 7}, "images": [{"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_1c4jSiRgogX_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00R0R_dRwjoyKLhnK_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/01515_hCX6GRfzOlr_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00101_3QshJrCrMAi_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_9wNnRaBlJjr_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00b0b_8a02BeywXct_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00U0U_f8i9nZogUpq_600x450.jpg"}, {"full": "http://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_k1QbeyMRMuQ_600x450.jpg"}], "immortal": 0, "external_id": "4570874492", "heading": "Looking For Roommate 2 Bedroom Apartment", "category": "RSHR", "external_url": "http://kansascity.craigslist.org/roo/4570874492.html"}, {"body": "Four rooms for rent, can move in immediately.
